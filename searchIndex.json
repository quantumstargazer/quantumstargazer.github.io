So while a muse's fandom might be tertiary in terms of activity, their verses/AUs for the primary fandom would likely have higher activity.\n\nBaldur's Gate\nTavares Umbrafae\n\n[!profile]+ Tavares Umbrafae (she/her)\nHalf-Fey Aevendrow — Wintertouched Long Night Scion — Misfortune Bringer\n\nTavares Umbrafae is an archfey warlock in service of the Prince of Frost, tasked with bringing misfortune to Faerûn in exchange for being allowed to return to the material plane after &quot;seven years and a day&quot; that proved to have lasted decades longer than were claimed.\nExiled from her home in Callidae when she returned decades after her disappearance, her pact to the Pale Prince clear with the binding marks she soon learns to hide with a glamour, she ventures out of the frozen north in search of her master's Prince's consort and to fulfill her assigned duties.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/baldur-s-gate/tavares-umbrafae/summary-tavares/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/baldur-s-gate/tavares-umbrafae/quick-guide-tavares/\">Quick Guide</a>\nWishlists\n\nFaeynore Moonstar\n\n[!profile]+ Faeynore Moonstar (they/she)\nMoon Elf — Private Investigator &amp; Spirit Medium — College of Glamour Bard\n\nFaeynore Moonstar is a private investigator out of Baldur's Gate, where she has often aided defendants in proving their innocence before the magistrates - including Magistrate Astarion Ancunín before his death some two centuries prior.\nThey have a specialized interest in Faerie and Infernal contracts, for how often their investigations have turned out to have such contracts involved.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/baldur-s-gate/faeynore-moonstar/summary-faeynore/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/baldur-s-gate/faeynore-moonstar/quick-guide-faeynore/\">Quick Guide</a>\nWishlists\n\nDirge\n\n[!profile]+ Dirge (they/she)\nGold Dwarf — College of Spirits Bard — Way of the Long Death Monk\n\nUnable to recall their life from before the nautiloid, they only know their name is The Dark Urge, that they are a bardic monk, and that everyone would look so much better as a pretty corpse...\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/baldur-s-gate/dirge/summary-dirge/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/baldur-s-gate/dirge/quick-guide-dirge/\">Quick Guide</a>\nWishlists\n\nDragon Age\nAshina de Riva née Tabris\n\n[!profile]+ Ashina de Riva (she/her)\nCity Elf — Grey Wardens (defected) Antivan Crows — Master Assassin\n\nAshina is conscripted against her will into the Grey Wardens at the start of the Fifth Blight in 9:30 Dragon, going by the name of &quot;Tathas Arainai&quot;. By 9:31 Dragon, she is notorious among the Wardens for having survived killing the archdemon and ending the Blight, only then to encounter the darkspawn magister known only as the Architect several months later, and letting it live. The First Warden issued orders for her to be brought in — alive — to Weisshaupt for questioning. No warden has survived the attempt until she is said to have been killed by the Antivan Crows in 9:33 Dragon.\nIn 9:33 Dragon, Ashina enters negotiations with the Fifth Talon of House de Riva, seeking protection from the Grey Wardens in exchange for her service to the House and the Crows. She is now a Master Assassin of House de Riva, and may serve as the Fifth Talon's Second.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/summary-ashina/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/connections-ashina/\">Connections</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/headcanons-ashina/\">Headcanons</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/quick-guide-ashina/\">Quick Guide</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/wishlists-ashina/\">Wishlists</a>\n\nZaehire de Riva\n\n[!profile]+ Zaehire de Riva (she/they)\nCasteless Royal Bastard Dwarf — Antivan Crows — Assassin Duelist\n\nPurchased by a House Arainai from her noble hunter mother in Orzammar mere days after her birth, Zaehire is raised from infancy to be a Crow. She is later freed from House Arainai by the Black Shadow, who aids her in getting as far as Salle, where she is taken in by House de Riva.\nAs a fledgling of House de Riva, Zaehire becomes Viago's protégé, as well as an occasional thorn in his side with her impulsiveness. And yet she often manages to turn those impulsive tendencies into boons for House de Riva, such as when she manages to negotiate her way into acting as a liaison between the House and the Carta, securing a steady supply of lyrium for de Riva's mages, and ensuring Carta assassins don't interfere in de Riva contracts.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/zaehire-de-riva/summary-zaehire/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nQuick Guide\nWishlists\n\nLeonardo de Riva\n\n[!profile]+ Leonardo de Riva (he/they)\nHuman Noble Orphan Mage — Antivan Crows — Spellblade Assassin\n\nLeonardo was the third son of a minor noble family in Salle, Antiva — a noble family that was desperately hiding its destitution from the rest of society. In 9:36, his parents and two older brothers are killed by Antivan Crows, and he is instead taken into House de Riva.\nWhen he is first brought into the House, he begins training as a rogue, only for his magic to make itself known many weeks later. He doesn't give up on his rogue training, insisting that he can manage both it and his magical training, and while many expected him to fail, his sheer determination to prove himself worthy of being a de Riva leads to his eventually studying to be a Spellblade Assassin.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/leonardo-de-riva/summary-leonardo/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nQuick Guide\nWishlists\n\nWard Ingellvar\n\n[!profile]+ Ward Ingellvar (they/them)\nSpirit of Learning Elf — Mourn Watch — Mortalitasi Death Caller\n\nWard Ingellvar is a foundling of the Necropolis, discovered deep within the lower levels of the Grand Necropolis as an infant by benevolent undead. As Vorgoth's ward, the elven child is raised within the Necropolis and the Mourn Watch. Their magic is awakened by the instability rippling through the Fade when the Breach opens in the south in 9:41 Dragon.\nWard is quiet and often reserved, tending to prefer the company of spirits and the benevolent undead. They are largely inexperienced when it comes to interacting with the living, especially anyone outside of the Mourn Watch and the Grand Necropolis, though they are always willing to learn, even if others aren't always as receptive to them in return.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ward-ingellvar/summary-ward/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ward-ingellvar/quick-guide-ward/\">Quick Guide</a>\nWishlists\n\nZevran Arainai\n\n[!profile]+ Zevran Arainai (he/him)\nCity Elf — Antivan Crows — Master Assassin — Eighth Talon [1]\n\nIn 9:45 Dragon, Zevran takes advantage of the chaos among the Houses with half of their Talons dead — including the Eighth Talon of House Arainai — and thus he claims the House and the position for himself, deciding that the only way the House is ever truly going to change is if they are destroyed completely, or he takes control of them himself.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/zevran-arainai/summary-zevran/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nQuick Guide\nWishlists\n\nHaleir Lavellan\n\n[!profile]+ Haleir Lavellan (she/her)\nDalish Exile Elf — Inquisition Followers of Fen'Harel — Inquisitor Agent of Fen'Harel\n\nBorn in Arlathan Forest amidst the ancient elvhen ruins, Haleir has long since been fascinated by Fen'Harel, spending her time playing around the wolf statues. When her magic awakens when she is only four years old, she is one mage too many for her clan to handle. With the next Arlathvhen being only two years away, the Keeper decides to start her magical training, but reaches out to the other clans to see who might be in need of a First, and she is traded to Clan Lavellan for that very purpose during the gathering of the clans.\nIn 9:41 Dragon, she ends up in the center of the chaos in southern Thedas with the Inquisition, going from being suspected of murder of the Divine to being named the Herald of Andraste in rapid succession. Soon after, she is named the Inquisitor, and leads the Inquisition to victory against Corypheus.\nIn 9:44 Dragon, Haleir abandons the Inquisition after learning who Solas truly is, instead joining him and his cause, following him through the eluvian.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/haleir-lavellan/summary-haleir/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nQuick Guide\nWishlists\n\nBertrand Ingellvar\n\n[!profile]+ Bertrand Ingellvar (he/him)\nQunari — Mourn Watch — Grand Necropolis Reaper Guard\n\nA foundling of the Grand Necropolis, Bertrand was raised within the Mourn Watch, and despite not having the magical talent needed to be a necromancer, he is still a skilled Watcher, though he mostly serves as a guard in the Necropolis.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/bertrand-ingellvar/summary-bertrand/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nQuick Guide\nWishlists\n\nMass Effect\nIsabela Shepard\n\n[!profile]+ Isabela Shepard (she/they)\nHuman Biotic — Paragade — Council Spectre — Infiltration Saboteur Engineer\n\nIsabela Shepard is an engineer, elite N7 operative, and the first human to be accepted as a Council Spectre. She is a registered biotic, but only possesses limited yet powerful biotic skill in combat.\nShe often defies expectations, as she refuses to kowtow to the Alliance's demands of putting humanity's interests first. Once she is given Spectre status, she stops answering to the Alliance Brass, pushing the fact that she now answers to no one but the Council, and refusing to become the Alliance's puppet Spectre.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/mass-effect/isabela-shepard/summary-isabela/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nQuick Guide\nWishlists\n\nNihlus Kryik\n\n[!profile]+ Nihlus Kryik (he/him)\nTurian — Renegon — Council Spectre — Havoc Soldier\n\nNihlus Kryik is one of the Council's most highly decorated Spectres. His once mentor, Saren Arterius, tries to murder him on Eden Prime by shooting at him from point blank range. Nihlus survives the attempt on his life, and joins his own protégé in their hunt to bring Saren to justice for the older Spectre's betrayal of the Council — and to hopefully find answers for himself for why Saren would betray him.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/mass-effect/nihlus-kryik/summary-nihlus/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nQuick Guide\nWishlists\n\nOther Fandoms\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nVerse &amp; timeline dependant. ↩︎",

She specialises in contracts for entire noble households, methodically wiping out an entire family line and their house in a single evening.\nWhile it is known among the Crows that she is also a Grey Warden, few outside of a handful of Talons and other high ranking Crows know that she is, in fact, the notorious Hero of Ferelden, widely known as &quot;Warden Tathas&quot;, who joined the Antivan Crows in 9:33 Dragon to escape from Weisshaupt and the First Warden's orders that she be brought in for questioning regarding her surviving killing an archdemon.\n\n[!info]- Verse Navigation\n\n|Dossier]]\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/headcanons-ashina/#dragon-age-headcanons\">Headcanons</a>\n|Verse]]\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/quick-guide-ashina/\">Quick Guide</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/wishlists-ashina/#dragon-age-wishlists\">Wishlists</a>\n\nCanon Divergent AUs\n\n[!verse]+ Rook\n\nDefaults to Veilguard timeline.

She was vocally against the Alienage tradition of only being recognized as an adult by marrying, fought to keep the hahren from trying to force Ashina to marry until she wanted to, and preferably for love.\nEven though she might not be his by blood, Ashina is Cyrion's daughter. She doesn't know who her biological father is, but it is most likely another elven Crow in House Arainai.\n\n[!stats]- Warden Ability: Blight Obfuscation\n(verse/timeline dependent - Ashina must be a Grey Warden)\n\nAshina is capable of obfuscating the blight in her veins, effectively hiding herself from both darkspawn and other wardens alike when she uses this ability.\nMuch like slipping into shadows, it takes some degree of focus to initiate and maintain this obfuscation, and is likely to drop when she must commit more focus to another action that renders her unable to maintain focus on suppressing the blight.\nWhen not in combat, Ashina can maintain the obfuscation for long periods of time so long as her attention is not too divided by other tasks, allowing her to stay hidden even while in conversation with another Grey Warden.\nWhen in combat, she will remain hidden for up to 4 seconds after the obfuscation drops before darkspawn and/or wardens may become aware of her blighted presence.\n\n[!stats]- Warden Ability: Power of Blood (Rogue)\n(verse/timeline dependent - Ashina must be a Grey Warden)\n\nin game: Power of Blood (Rogue)\n\nThings Your Muse Could Know\n\n[!hint]- Warden Tathas Arainai is killed by the Crows in 9:33 Dragon\n(verse/timeline dependent - Ashina must be a Grey Warden &amp; the HoF)\n\nAshina takes up Master Ignacio's offer to join the Crows when she tires of being a Warden, entering negotiations with the Fifth Talon of House de Riva in 9:33 Dragon to secure a promise of protection from the Order of the Grey Wardens in return for her service as an Antivan Crow within House de Riva.\n\n[!hint]- Warden Tathas Arainai is wanted by Weisshaupt\n(verse/timeline dependent - Ashina must be a Grey Warden &amp; the HoF)\nThe First Warden has ordered that &quot;Warden Tathas Arainai&quot;, also known as the Hero of Ferelden, the Warden-Commander of Ferelden, and de facto Arlessa of Amaranthine, be brought in to Weisshaupt for questioning pertaining to her survival after killing the Archdemon Urthemiel, as well as her encounter with the Architect, among many other things he seeks answer to about her activities during the Fifth Blight itself.\nTimeline in effect:\n\nPost-Amaranthine Crisis — 9:31 Dragon onward\n\nWho could know this fact:\n\nGrey Wardens — most wardens enlisted at the time in and/or after 9:31 Dragon are under orders by the First Warden to bring &quot;Warden Tathas&quot; in by any means necessary for questioning.\nAntivan Crows — must be influential enough to have been made aware of any details, but rumours are bound to have spread throughout the Houses, even among the fledglings, when they learn of the de Riva fledgling joining the ranks in 9:31 Dragon who is a Grey Warden and the new Warden-Commander of Antiva.\n\nThings Your Muse Should Not Know\n\n[!attention]- Ashina is Warden Tathas Arainai - the Hero of Ferelden\n(verse/timeline conditional - Ashina must be a Grey Warden &amp; the HoF)\n\nWhen Ashina is conscripted into the Grey Wardens, she insists that she not be enlisted under her real name, for her family's protection.\nThe name in the recruit roster lists her as &quot;Tathas Adaia Arainai&quot; — named such after the story she tells the kids playing in the alley about the elven hero-thief, and her mother.\nOnce she leaves Denerim, only Duncan knows her true identity, but only refers to her as Tathas, per her request — it is this name that she uses to introduce herself throughout the course of the Fifth Blight, and throughout the Amaranthine Crisis.\n\nPre-Established Exceptions (open to plotting)\n\nThere are some who may know her true identity after 9:33 Dragon, when she joins the Antivan Crows. This includes a few of the Talons, primarily the Fifth Talon (Viago's predecessor) and First Talon (likely Caterina Dellamorte), as well as a handful of Master Assassins and other influential Crows, such as Viago de Riva, Andarateia Cantori, and Lucanis Dellamorte (if they do not know the truth sooner, they will likely learn it when they become Talons themselves).\n\nWhen This Could Be Revealed (open to plotting)\n\nVeilguard (9:50 - 9:54 Dragon)\n\nROOK: de Riva or Thorne\nRECRUITMENT: Lucanis Dellamorte &amp;/or Davrin\nENCOUNTER: First Warden &amp; Senior Wardens\nEVENT: Blighted dragon attack on Treviso\nEVENT: Siege at Weisshaupt\n\nInquisition (9:40 - 9:44 Dragon)\n\nCOMPANION: Varric Tethras &amp;/or Hawke (if met in Kirkwall)\nENCOUNTER: Senior Wardens\nLOCATION: City of Redcliffe\nENCOUNTER: King &amp;/or Queen of Ferelden\nENCOUNTER: Hawke's Grey Warden Contact\nEVENT: Siege at Adamant Fortress\n\nKirkwall (9:35 - 9:39 Dragon)\n\nCOMPANION: Anders &amp;/or Justice\nEVENT: Deep Roads Expedition\nEVENT: Qunari Invasion of Kirkwall\nENCOUNTER: Nathanial Howe &amp;/or Senior Wardens\nEVENT: Fall of the Gallows\n\n[!attention]- Searching for a cure for the blight\n(verse/timeline dependent - Ashina must be a Grey Warden)\n\nAshina learns of a potential cure in 9:33 Dragon from the gift left behind by Morrigan at the eluvian.\nAs a master herbalist, Ashina is skilled enough to pull it off, if she can find the information and components she needs to do so.\nHer joining the Crows in that same year, however, sets her back, as she is unable to dedicate the necessary time and effort to her research — she may likely rely on Zevran to do much of the legwork for this, even while he is still dealing with House Arainai and some of the other, more brutal houses within the Crows.\nAshina does not immediately involve many people in her search, in part because of the conditions of her contract with House de Riva and the Crows that ensures the contracts that were taken out against &quot;Tathas Arainai&quot; are considered complete now that &quot;Warden Tathas&quot; is dead and she is a de Riva.\n\nPre-Approved Exceptions\n\nMorrigan - have the information to Ashina in the first place\nZevran Arainai - likely helping search while she's a fledgling, and a rank &amp; file Crow, as she's largely restricted to Antiva during this time\n\nCanon Typical\nDragon Age Guides\nThings You Should Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Could Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Should Not Know\n\n[!attention]-\n\nCanon Divergent AUs\nRook Guides\nThings You Should Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Could Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Should Not Know\n\n[!attention]-\n\nInquisitor Guides\nThings You Should Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Could Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Should Not Know\n\n[!attention]-\n\nInquisitor Crow Guides\nThings You Should Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Could Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Should Not Know\n\n[!attention]-\n\nCrows' Due Guides\nThings You Should Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Could Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Should Not Know\n\n[!attention]-\n\nCrows' Design Guides\nThings You Should Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Could Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Should Not Know\n\n[!attention]-\n\nAntivan Crows Guides\nThings You Should Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Could Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Should Not Know\n\n[!attention]-\n\nLyrium Ghost Guides\nThings You Should Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Could Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Should Not Know\n\n[!attention]-\n\nFandom Specific AUs\nBaldur's Gate AUs\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nDragon Age AUs\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nMass Effect AUs\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nOther Fandoms AUs\nDoctor Who AUs\nIn Time &amp; Space Guides\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nElder Scrolls AUs\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nStardew Valley AUs\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nTrapped In Another World AUs\nBaldur's Gate AWs\nAbsolute Crisis Guides\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nDragon Age AWs\nThis Shit Is Weird Guides\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nMass Effect AWs\nAnomaly Detected Guides\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nOther Fandoms AWs\nDoctor Who AWs\nCompanion Guides\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nElder Scrolls AWs\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nStardew Valley AWs\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nOther Verses &amp; AUs\nOther Verse Guides\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nPrivate Verses &amp; AUs\nPartner - PartnerMuse\nPrivate Verse Guides\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available",

It's a matter of public record about her, though she doesn't make a habit of volunteering the information to people who haven't sought it out on their own either.\nShe will only to into details of her past with those she is close to who actually bother asking her about them. Otherwise, she might hint at some of the weirder things she got to to as a kid just to mess with people, but never elaborates any further without them being close friends and in private away from others that she doesn't want to know such things about her.\n\nThings Your Muse Should Not Know\n\n[!attention]- Isabela's Parents\nIsabela's parents vanished when they went to work one day, only to never return. Isabela was only 6 when she was effectively orphaned by this turn of events, and she never has learned the truth of her parents' fate.\nHer father was a scientist, and her mother was an engineer. They worked for the same organization, though it will be many years before it comes to light that they were essentially part of the early operations of Cerberus.\nPre-Approved Exceptions:\n\nThe Illusive Man\nSaren Arterius\nAvitus Rix\nNihlus Kryik\n\nCanon Typical\nTrilogy Guides\nThings You Should Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Could Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Should Not Know\n\n[!attention]-\n\nCanon Divergent AUs\nVerseAU Guides\nThings You Should Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Could Know\n\n[!hint]-\n\nThings Your Muse Should Not Know\n\n[!attention]-\n\nFandom Specific AUs\nBaldur's Gate AUs\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nDragon Age AUs\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nMass Effect AUs\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nOther Fandoms AUs\nDoctor Who AUs\nIn Time &amp; Space Guides\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nElder Scrolls AUs\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nStardew Valley AUs\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nTrapped In Another World AUs\nBaldur's Gate AWs\nAbsolute Crisis Guides\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nDragon Age AWs\nThis Shit Is Weird Guides\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nMass Effect AWs\nAnomaly Detected Guides\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nOther Fandoms AWs\nDoctor Who AWs\nCompanion Guides\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nElder Scrolls AWs\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nStardew Valley AWs\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nOther Verses &amp; AUs\nOther Verse Guides\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available\n\nPrivate Verses &amp; AUs\nPartner - PartnerMuse\nPrivate Verse Guides\n\n[!attention] Not Currently Available",

		"content": "Quantum Stargazer Wiki\n\n[!WARNING]+ Testing In Progress\nGreat work. Because this message is prerecorded, any observations related to your performance are speculation on our part. Please disregard any undeserved compliments.\n\n[!error]- Under Emergency Construction\nSite is under emergency construction after the old wiki decided to start suffering from fatal errors on the host's end, so things are going to be a bit chaotic while I try to salvage the data from the old site to add to this one. Please be patient, as I am chronically ill and unable to always dedicate a lot of time and energy to this effort.\n\nQuantum Stargazer\nQuantum Stargazer is an Independent, Selective, 21+ &amp; Mutuals Only Multifandom Multimuse blog featuring canon, canon-based, and original characters from Baldur's Gate[1], Dragon Age, Mass Effect, &amp; more.\nRP Info\n\nMulti-Ship - Ships are not Highlanders — there can be more than one. And there will be. There will be.[2]\nMulti-Verse - All <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses-roster/\">Open Muses</a> have Canon-Based Verses, Fandom Specific AUs, Trapped In Another World AUs, &amp;/or Other Verses &amp; AUs.\nExtremely Crossover Friendly - If a verse &amp;/or doesn't exist, so long as I'm even remotely familiar with and interested in the fandom, chances are good that I'll add a verse to make it happen.\nLoose Plotting Only - Not a heavy or strict planner; if you are, then I'm probably not who you want to try to plot with.\nIn Character Posts Immediately - IC posts are never queued — only prompts, memes, aesthetics, etc. are queued.\n\n[!ziggy]- Wordy AF - Unapologetically Neurodivergent\nAuDHD means infodumping is likely to occur, and this means my posts, as well as the notes here, are likely to get wordy. I tend to try to be mindful of individual paragraph lengths, but there will often be a lot of paragraphs and/or bullet points.\nIf, for any reason, you are troubled by being expected to actually read things in a writing hobby that should, in theory, require at least 50% reading, considering its collaborative nature, then I'm probably not the roleplay partner for you.\n\nBlanket Permissions\nMutuals do not have to ask or wait for posts prompting them to do any of the following:\n\nSend Prompts/Memes To Inbox\n\nReverse Prompts/Memes\nAdd Context, Tone Indicators, Etc. To Prompts/Memes\nContinue Answered Asks As Threads\n\nWrite Starters For My Muses\n\nUnprompted Random Starters\nFill Starter Calls - Ask To Specify If Needed\n\nReply To Open Starters\n\nAvailable to ALL Mutuals\nCan adjust to fit most of the muse's verses &amp;/or AUs\n*Will create custom closed starters based on any upon request\n\nRequest That I Send Them Prompts/Memes\n\nUse &quot;Inbox Call&quot; form\n\nRequest That I Write Them Starters\n\nUse &quot;Starter Call&quot; form\nOr join the &quot;Best Friends Call&quot; members list by filling out that form\n\nAsk To Plot For Threads, Verses, AUs, Etc.\n\nMessage on discord (only place I currently can handle plotting)\n\nAsk To Ship, Plot Dynamics, Etc.\n\nMessage on discord &amp;/or via tumblr inbox\n\nAdd As Friend On Discord\n\nThread Tracking\n\n[!tracker]- Important Note About Thread Tracking\nI do not use the RP Thread Tracker quite as intended. Most notably where the Archive and Queue is concerned.\n\nAny in character post tagged with &quot;; partnerurl / partnermuse &amp; my muse / 000&quot; is intended to be added to the tracker — Havu (lanternlit) is helping to make sure everything actually gets tracked.\nOnly active threads are in the front most view, so I can keep tabs what I currently have going on — anything else is either marked as Archived or Queued for storage purposes.\n\nThreads Inactive For Longer Than 2+ Months\n\nThreads that have been on &quot;their turn&quot; for 2+ months are sent to the Archive for storage until it is replied to — these threads are still accessible through the public view's dropdown menu to access Archived threads.\n\nI do not consider these threads dropped unless I have updated the title to mark them as such. If you have outright dropped a thread, please notify me directly. This can be done through discord, tumblr IM, and/or the tumblr inbox.\n\nThreads that have been on my turn for 2+ months are potentially sent to the Queue for storage if they're stuck in drafts due to low muse activity — again, they're still accessible through the dropdown menu to access Queued threads.\n\nThese posts are not actually queued, however, as I never queue in character posts. It is just a functional way of setting them aside in the tracker so as not to overwhelm me when I know I'm not going to be replying to that post for a while, and it should automatically release it from being marked as queued when I do eventually get it posted.\nLikewise, these threads are also not dropped — some muses, or even just some verses for that muse, are simply slower than others, and so interactions may go months without being replied to if I have little to no muse for them at the time.\n\nWhere You Can See What's Tracked\n\nThread Tracker - all threads, regardless of whose turn it is\nTheir Turn - only threads that are on someone else's turn\nZiggy’s Turn - only threads that are on my turn\n\n[!guideline]- Regarding Tracking &amp; Dropped Threads\nI very rarely drop threads myself simply due to a lack of interest, so this is not something you need to worry about, even if it takes me a long time to reply to a thing. I will get to it eventually, or I will reach out and let you know that I need to drop it because I'm unable to find a way to continue it.\nIf you lose interest in a thread, I would appreciate it if you would please just let me know so I can mark it as dropped &amp;/or ended, rather than letting it sit as being archived and still waiting for a potential reply to come in. I'm an avid reader of work-in-progress fics on AO3 — I will wait literal years for a continuation, and that includes roleplay threads (it's something I've regularly done in the past on my old blogs).\nIf you're never going to reply to something, I'd rather just know rather than being expected to assume — assumptions make asses out of people, more often than not, and again, I'm neurodivergent AF and disabled, so my assumptions are always going to lean to a far kinder &quot;they're probably just busy/too tired/brainfoggy/etc&quot; side of things rather than &quot;oh, they've lost interest and I should move on from that thread&quot; that most people seem to assume.\n\nInterest Forms\n\n[!rule]- Interest Assumed For All Open Muses\nUnless you fill out the Disinterest Tracker to tell me otherwise, if we're mutuals, it's assumed you're interested in interacting with any and all of my Open Muses in any of their canon-based verses and/or their fandom matched verses &amp; AUs.\n\nDisinterest Tracker - for telling me who you are not interested in interacting with\nRP Preferences Tracker - for telling me your preferences for interactions, plotting, etc.\nBest Friends Call - the closest thing I have to a 'permanent starter call', with benefits\n\nInteractions Calls\n\n[!guideline]- Request Interaction At Any Time\nThese forms are here to let you request interaction at any time, whether I'm actively on the dash or not (I lurk way more than it appears, since I don't really post from mobile, but I do read and draft things while afk from my desktop).\n\nStarter Call - for requesting that I write a starter for your muse(s)\nInbox Call - for requesting that I send prompts/memes to your inbox\n\nRules &amp; Guidelines\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/actual-rules/\">The Actual Rules</a> - must be read before following\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/guidelines/\">RP Guidelines</a> - may not apply to everyone\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/rp-faq/\">Frequently Asked Questions</a> - answers to common things that have come up over the years\n\nMuse Rosters\n\n[!faq]- Activity Levels Based On Fandom - Not Individual Muse\n\nActivity is based on the fandom as opposed to the individual muse.\nSo when Dragon Age is my highest actively, all Dragon Age muses and the Dragon Age AUs for my other muses are more likely to have quicker turn arounds than any other muse in any other fandom, whether it is their canon-based verse and/or AU for other fandoms.\nI do it this way because individual muse actively varies drastically and frequently, whereas fandom actively tends to be centered more on my current hyperfixation, and is slower to change activity levels.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses-roster/\">Open Muses</a> - priority muses — available to everyone\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/by-request-only-roster/\">By Request Only</a> - available only on request\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/friends-only-roster/\">Friends Only</a> - by invitation only\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/irregulars-roster/\">Irregulars</a> - available only for Mains &amp; Best Friends Call Members\n\nAbout the Mun\n\nname/alias: Ziggy\npronouns: they/them\nage: 40+\n\n[!example]+ Fandoms\n\nBaldur's Gate[1:1] - secondary — moderate activity\nDragon Age - primary — high activity\nMass Effect - tertiary — low activity\n\n[!todo]- Other Fandoms\nThis is not an extensive list of fandoms I'm interested in &amp;/or familiar with enough to roleplay with. Please note: I don't keep up well with modern media, so don't expect me to be familiar with new things as soon as they come out.\n\nAddams Family\nBioShock\nDC (focus: Batman: The Animated Series)\nDetroit: Become Human\nDoctor Who (Expanded Universe)\nDungeons &amp; Dragons (tabletop rpg)\nElder Scrolls\nFallout\nForgotten Realms (D&amp;D setting)\nGhostbusters (focus: The Real Ghostbusters)[3]\nMarvel (focus: Iron Man/Tony Stark)[4]\nOur Flag Means Death\nPortal\nThe Stanley Parable\nStar Trek (focus: Original Series through Voyager)\nStardew Valley\nSupernatural\n\nIncorporates Forgotten Realms and D&amp;D/AD&amp;D lore for individual characters as needed, mostly through BG3 mods, but occasionally just additional lore needed to further flesh out the characters. ↩︎ ↩︎\n\nShips with chemistry only ↩︎\n\nWhen I am writing Peter Venkman, he is not the movie-verse Venkman, but rather the further developed characterization from The Real Ghostbusters (ie the sharp minded businessman who has a soft spot for kids and little old ladies who remind him of his mom) and it is extremely important that this is respected — failure to do so will likely result in the interactions being dropped. ↩︎\n\nMostly the Marvel Cinematic Universe, prior to Avengers: Infinity War. In terms of my portrayal of Tony Stark, his MCU canon stops at Captain America: Civil War, where it then goes fully AU with dimensional travel and franchise swap, as he will be written as part of the DC universe, primarily focused on that of Batman: The Animated Series (as well as most of the animated movies), in addition to some fanmade content to be detailed in Tony's info once I'm ready to actually start writing him again. ↩︎",

		"url":"/rules-and-guidelines/actual-rules/",
		"content": "The Actual Rules\n\n[!attention]- Read Rules Before Following\nI actively block people who obviously did not read my rules before following me first — typically for their being under the age of 21, and/or their blog containing banned content such as fandoms, faceclaims, &amp;/or tropes &amp; themes.\n\nBe sure to check the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/additional-faq/do-s-and-don-t-s-faq/\">Do's &amp; Don't's of Interacting</a> before you actually start interacting.\n\nDon't Be A Dick\nThis should got without saying, and yet...[1]\n\n21+ &amp; Mutuals Only\n\n[!caution]- Viewer Discretion Is Advised\nMost of my fandoms are literally rated M for Mature Audiences, and as such my blogs and wiki are rated the same. See <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/additional-faq/mature-audiences-only-faq/\">Mature Audiences Only - FAQ</a> for additional information, including a list of content that you may need to be aware of regarding squicks and triggers.\n\n[!rule]- Must Be 18+ To Follow\nI hard block any minors — as well as any blogs who do not list an age at all — who follow me. I do not roleplay with anyone under the age of 21, however, so if you are 18 to 20, you are welcome to follow, but I will not be writing with you until you are at least 21.\n\nIf you don't have an age range that actively states you are at least 21+ listed on your blog and/or in your rules, I will not follow you, nor will I write roleplay with you. I am in my early 40s, and just simply do not wish to write with anyone younger than US drinking age at this point.\n\nCurate Your Own Dash\n\n[!fail]- Regarding Others' &quot;Dead Dove: Do Not Eat&quot; Warnings\nI do not follow anyone whose only warnings for their blog consists of &quot;Dead Dove&quot; without covering what topics, themes, tropes, etc. are likely to be found on the blog. And given that I typically block blogs with explicit roleplayed scenes involving rape, sexual assault, Alpha/Beta/Omega dynamics, etc., if &quot;Dead Dove: Do Not Eat&quot; is the only warning you provide, then I'm going to assume those things are exactly what you write, and will proceed to curate my own dash accordingly by blocking you.\nWithout any explanation, &quot;Dead Dove: Do Not Eat&quot; as effective as saying &quot;Warning: Consider Yourself Warned&quot; while inviting people to potentially walk into a nuclear reactor. It is meant to be a warning of &quot;don't blame me if you find content here you didn't like because you didn't read the warning labels provided&quot; — if you don't provide those warnings, then you don't get to complain when people don't want to interact with you at all instead of risking that content they're sensitive to may appear on your blog.\n\nDon't Like? Don't Follow.\nIf you don't like me, my muses, my verses, my blog, etc., then just don't follow me — in fact, if you feel that strongly about any of these things, you should probably hard block me and keep me blocked [2] instead, so as to keep my content off your dash.\nHard Block Only - No Soft Block\nIf you feel the need to block me at all for any reason, hard block me, even if you typically only soft block. I am unable to reliably remember if someone has simply soft blocked me instead, and may refollow if I find your blog again in the future, being completely unable to remember that I had followed you in the past.

It is for the best that I simply remain blocked, and that if you move to a new blog in the future, especially if you change your username, that you continue to block me from the new blog(s) as well. ↩︎ ↩︎\n\nIf pregnancy becomes a part of any interaction, the active labor and childbirth will be time skipped to when the baby has arrived and has been cleaned up — no exceptions. ↩︎\n\nI don't care how anti-JK Rowling you are — I will not follow or interact with you if you have any Harry Potter muses or verses/AUs on your blog. If we are mutuals, and you add such muses and/or verses/AUs in the future, I will break mutual status by hard blocking you. There will be no exceptions to this rule. ↩︎\n\nIf they have genuine face acting roles, such as would be the case with someone like David Bowie in Labyrinth (1986), then they're fine. Cameos do not count, especially in the case of Youtubers. ↩︎ ↩︎",

Just send your muses my way!\nSend prompts/memes at any time - Prompts/memes never expire, and the inbox is always open.\nAdd extra context to any prompts/memes - If you have thoughts on the context in which the prompts occur, absolutely feel free to add it as a note in the ask when sending it — I answer all asks as text posts for easier continuation as threads, so I can leave any additional notes out of it if requested and/or marked as private for the context.\nReverse any prompts/memes - Whether the original post suggests it or not, you can always request a reverse on a prompt, including sentence starters (though I will use my judgement as to whether or not my muse would actually say the line, in that case, but I can usually manage it).\nWrite me random starters - So long as we're mutuals, I want to write with you. If you're in the mood to write starters, absolutely feel free to write one or more for my muse(s). No need to wait for me to respond to a starter call.\nReply to my open starters - That's literally what they're there for, after all! So long as we're mutuals, you're good to go. They are not just for new mutuals and/or people who haven't started interacting yet.\nFill out the interest forms - This will make interactions go a lot more smoothly all around, truly.\nTake inspiration from my AUs - I'm a firm supporter of transformative works, so absolutely take inspiration from my work.\nAsk questions about my muses, their verses, &amp;/or AUs - I'm always happy to ramble about things to satisfy others' curiosity about these things.\nRead the muse &amp; verse info - This is really important, since while I say things are &quot;canon-typical&quot;, that does not mean they're canon-compliant. I don't expect you to remember each and every little detail, but some things are big enough to throw things off course if you assume it's the same as in canon when it's not. A &quot;Quick Guide To Interactions&quot; is added to the bottom of all dossiers and verse details to assist with this.\nAsk to start over - I default to trying to maintain some sense of continuity between interactions with the same muse pairings within the same verse (ie the events of one thread may actively affect the events of another, if they take place with the same verse between the same muses written with the same partner). If you're not happy with the direction things are going in within our interactions, feel free to ask to start over. We can plot things out a little to figure out the direction to move things in from there.\nTell me if you want to ship - I ship with chemistry, but that doesn't mean I can't handle hearing your wants for a future ship and/or dynamic. It just gives us something to build towards if we're both mutually interested in the same thing there.\nAdd me on discord - If we are mutuals, you can always add me on discord (lefae639605) to chat/plot/whatever.\nScream at me in discord at all ungodly hours - Seriously, I rarely sleep, so chances are online anyway, regardless of what timezone you're in.\nRandomly drop plot ideas on me whenever - Just be forewarned that I may take them and turn them into a starter with little to no further enabling.\nLike and comment and subscribe on headcanons or thoughts about muses - This will truly make my day.\n\nThings You Should NOT Do\n\nDon't be a dick - This is ultimately what all of the rules &amp; guidelines boil down to.\nDon't send anonymous hate - Anon is a privilege, not a right. I keep it on for prompts/memes, and the socially anxious. Not for dicks to be assholes. If you send anon hate, know that it will be screencapped and shared and mocked in private among my friends, while the ask itself will be reported to tumblr for harassment.\nDon't follow without at least reading the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/actual-rules/\">Actual Rules</a> bits - Seriously, this has become that much of an issue...\nDon't interact without reading the rules &amp; guidelines - It will inevitably become obvious you didn't read them, and chances are that I will likely simply block you, depending on the severity of the lines crossed as a result.\nDon't assume I am my muses - Honestly, just read this psa for more on this one.\nDon't reblog things you're not a part of - This especially goes for roleplay threads, &quot;missing scenes&quot; (ficlets that are tied to specific ships &amp;/or dynamics), headcanons, verse details, etc. If you're not actively tagged in them, they are not for you to reblog without my express permission.\nDon't use my blog as your resource - I'm good at finding cool shit, but please reblog from the source and/or the sideblogs that I myself am most likely reblogging from, rather than spamming my roleplay notifications. Mutuals actively interacting with me have more leeway and can reblog directly from me, just don't go overboard.\nDon't feed my writing into any AI - This is theft and a blatant copyright violation, and you will be blocked and reported.\nDon't use AI to write &amp;/or create images for me - I want to be creative with people, not machines.\nDon't softblock me — only hardblock if you feel the need to block - If you feel the need to get me off your dash, outright hardblock me. My memory cannot be trusted to remember who to avoid refollowing, so it's better to just outright block me and keep me blocked instead.\nDon't take it personally if I block you - Again, my memory is absolute shit, so I end up blocking liberally for a wide range of reasons, most of which don't have anything to with with the individuals personally.\nDon't assume interactions are in the same universe - Like, sure, between the same muse pairing with the same mun, a lot of them might be, if they're under the same verse tag, at least. But something with Mun A is always in a separate universe from anything with Mun B, unless we're mutual mutuals who have plotted a shared universe together that would be tagged as such, but those are exceptionally rare cases, and honestly not likely to happen.\nDon't assume anything &amp;/or everything I write is &quot;canon accurate&quot; - I rely heavily on canon divergence, headcanons, mod integration, etc. I enjoy the hell out of a wide range of AUs, crossovers, etc. Canon is my sandbox, and I will destroy and rebuild it as I please.\nDon't write my muses for me - This pertains to their dialogue, thoughts, feelings, introspection, etc. It is safe to assume that, if I don't write them resisting an action such as following your muse to another room, being touched, etc., that it is accepted as having occurred without having to explicitly write the action from their point of view. What's not accepted is you deciding for me how my muse feels, thinks, react emotionally and/or psychologically, etc.\nDon't panic - And always know where your towel is.",

I think Isabela Shepard (Mass Effect) might be fun to write against them. Izzy has no less than 3 AUs for Dragon Age for me to choose from, including at least one where she is native to Thedas as an artificer and assassin rather than being her canon-based self from within the Mass Effect setting, so I pick the most suitable verse for the interaction I have in mind and send her your way.\n\nIf Not Filled Out, All Open Muses Are Fair Game\nRather than having to require people to fill out an Interest Tracker to opt-in to which muses they're interested in actually interacting with, now mutuals are assumed to have interest in all <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses-roster/\">Open Muses</a>, and their Canon-Based Verses &amp;/or their fandom matched Fandom Specific AUs &amp;/or Trapped In Another World AUs unless they have opted-out by way of filling out the Disinterest Tracker form.\nIt's Fine To Only Have Interest In Some Muses\nI would rather know that you're only interested in specific muses, even if it's just one or two in the whole roster, than to have things frequently and often silently dropped because you're not actually interested in them. This is what the form is for, so I know not to send you muses you don't want to write with, and/or within which verses.\nHighly Recommended But Not Required\nThis form is technically optional, but if I start sending you muses and/or verses you don't actually want to interact with, it's entirely on you for not telling me who not to send your way.\n\nRP Preference Tracker\n\n[!help] Not Yet Implemented\n\nNot everyone in the rpc operates in the same way, and interests can be wide and extremely varied. The RP Preference Tracker is intended to cover as least the basics of what I usually prefer to know that isn't always covered in other people's guidelines, and aren't always answered through some random memes post or a reblogged PSA.\nOptional But Recommended\nThis form is completely optional, but recommended, especially if you're wanting to run multiple threads with the same muse pairings, potentially develop ships &amp;/or deeper dynamics, have topics/tropes you specifically don't want to write, etc.\n\nBest Friends Call\n\n[!info]- Intended For Mutuals Who Have Already Started Interacting\nIf we haven't even said so much as &quot;hello&quot; to each other yet, chances are it's too soon to fill this form out. This is effectively a permanent starter call, and if we've yet to start writing &amp;/or plotting together, I'm not going to add you to the members list until we are.\n\nThis is the closest thing I have to a permanent starter call, and it comes with additional benefits beyond my just sending you starters at random.\nTerms of Use\nShould you choose to join this list, you are helping reduce anxiety to interact on a regular basis by providing me with authorisation for the following:\n\nThe right to send/tag you in starters whenever the whim takes me;\nThe right to send you a message via IM/Discord/Ask with plots/ideas for threads/AUs/general buffoonery;\nThe right to tag you in shit that I come across that makes me take pause and think ‘Yup. This is them. This is them to a T. This is our idiots.’;\nThe right to tag you in wishlist stuff;\nThe right to send you a shit tonne[1] of prompts/memes should you reblog same;\nThe above rights are reciprocal;\n\nYou can send/tag me in starters whenever the whim takes you, including whenever you post starter calls that I may have missed on the dash;\nYou can send me messages via Discord and/or tumblr ask with plots/ideas for threads/AUs/general buffoonery;\nYou can tag me in shit that you come across that makes you take pause and think ‘Yup. This is them. This is them to a T.

I also have the Best Friends Call Members, and Ships &amp; Dynamics Partners, that also gain priority for interactions, as these are the people I often interact with the most.\nMuses I won't interact with duplicates of:\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Exclusives</a>\n\nMuses I will interact with duplicates of:\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Mains</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Best Friends Call Members</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Ships &amp; Dynamics</a>\n\nOther People's Exclusivity\nNo Exclusives On Follow\nDo not make my muses your exclusives simply based on your following following my blog.

I am not willing to be near anyone's exclusive portrayal of any given canon and/or canon-inspired muse, largely in part due to the fact that my activity is often so sporadic, it would not only be unfair to you to limit yourself in that way, but also unfair to me for you trying to place that expectation of availability on me, which I would not be able to guarantee to be able to maintain.",

These guidelines are only an expansion of that and may not apply to everyone, depending on fandoms, interaction preferences, interest in shipping, etc., unlike the rules themselves.\n\nBlanket Permissions\nMutuals do not have to ask or wait for posts prompting them to do any of the following:\n\nSend Prompts/Memes To Inbox\n\nReverse Prompts/Memes\nAdd Context, Tone Indicators, Etc. To Prompts/Memes\nContinue Answered Asks As Threads\n\nWrite Starters For My Muses\n\nUnprompted Random Starters\nFill Starter Calls - Ask To Specify If Needed\n\nReply To Open Starters\n\nAvailable to ALL Mutuals\nCan adjust to fit most of the muse's verses &amp;/or AUs\nWill create custom closed starters based on any upon request\n\nRequest That I Send Them Prompts/Memes\n\nUse &quot;Inbox Call&quot; form\n\nRequest That I Write Them Starters\n\nUse &quot;Starter Call&quot; form\nOr join the &quot;Best Friends Call&quot; members list by filling out that form\n\nAsk To Plot For Threads, Verses, AUs, Etc.\n\nMessage on discord (only place I currently can handle plotting)\n\nAsk To Ship, Plot Dynamics, Etc.\n\nMessage on discord &amp;/or via tumblr inbox\n\nAdd As Friend On Discord\n\nInteractions\nContinuity\nI prefer to have a sense of continuity in the majority of my in character interactions. While strict one shots have their time and place, they're not what I really enjoy for the long term.\nSeparate Multi-Verse Continuities\nThis continuity is based on an individual partner basis — the continuity with one partner between our muses does not have an effect on the continuity between muses with another partner, even if they fall under the same general verse tag.\nStarters\nRandom Starters\nI do, on occasion, write random, unprompted starters for people, but usually this is reserved for my Mains and the Best Friends Call Members. So if you'd like me to just send stuff at you randomly, please fill out the Best Friends Call form to give me permission to do so.\nWrite Starters For Me Whenever\nThis is blanket permission for you to write starters for me whenever you're interested in doing so. I don't always catch every starter call that comes across the dash, and my anxiety often can interfere in my interacting with them even when I do see them.\n\n[!guideline] Automatic Starter Calls\nSo if you're hoping that I'll like your starter call, please just take this as permission to say that I did so and write me a starter. If you want me to narrow down muses or anything, hit me up on discord or in my inbox, and I'll get back to you as soon as I'm able.\n\nRequesting Starters\nYou can request for me to write starters for your muses from mine at any time by filling out the Starter Call form linked in the pinned post and/or on the homepage of this site.\n\n[!guideline] Form Required To Request Starters\nThe form is very minimal, but is easier for me to keep track of what has and has not been filled than posts with &quot;like this post for a starter&quot;, especially since I prefer it when people actually specify which muses and/or verses they want starters from.\nThe form does offer a &quot;Ziggy's Choice&quot; option for those who aren't picky and/or are feeling indecisive, though I may be slower to fill such requests if I don't have any direction whatsoever to work from.\n\nOpen Starters\nI have dozens of open starters available, which can be replied to at any time, regardless of how long ago I posted it, and/or if it already has replies to it. I try to remember to move each reply to a new text post for thread tracking purposes (or may just repost the starter if I forget so I can carry on the thread to the original post).\nFor Mutuals Only\nOpen Starters are for mutuals only, as is indicated in the starter post itself. Beyond that, they are rarely limited in any other way, but please be sure to read the tags before replying if there are any limits or restrictions mentioned.\nCustomized Upon Request\nIf the starter doesn't quite fit for your muse, verse, etc., I am more than happy to rewrite it as a closed starter for you instead. All you have to do is ask (either through discord, tumblr IMs, or the inbox) — just be sure to include the link to the original starter so I know which one it is you want me to base a closed starter on for you.\nInbox\nYou can send asks/prompts/memes/etc. to the inbox on either quantumstargazer and/or gazingintoquantumstars[1].\nReverse Prompts/Memes\nYou are always welcome to reverse any meme and/or prompts (including sentence starters), simply by stating that you want it reversed, whether the original meme/prompt mentions the option in it or not.\nWe're here to have fun, so if something fits better if it's my muse doing or saying the thing instead of yours (or vise versa, depending on the meme/prompt), then I'm game for flipping the script regardless of what the original meme/prompt poster intended.\nAdding Context To Memes/Prompts\nYou are always welcome to add context and/or expand on any meme and/or prompt (including sentence starters). In fact, it helps a great deal whenever someone does if they have something in particular in mind.\nThis is especially true for things like indicating tone, where you might imagine them saying something one way, but I might interpret it another way, as I can't always locate the original prompt/meme for the original context, if any was given at all.\n\n[!guideline] Answered As Text Posts\nAs I always turn text-based asks into text posts rather than publishing the original ask, if you mention you want any part of the ask kept private (do so in the ask itself so that it doesn't get lost in chats), I will simply not copy that part of the message into the text post when I actually publish it.\n\nContinue As Threads\nYou are always welcome to continue answered in character prompts/memes as threads. I answer most asks as new text posts, and will tag these as &quot;Closed Starter&quot;, along with a thread tracking tag[2], if I anticipate it to potentially continued as a thread.\nPrompts Never Expire\nThere is no expiration date on most memes/prompts/etc. (I might side-eye you if you send a winter holiday meme in the July, though), and they can be found on both quantumstargazer and gazingintoquantumstars, and can be sent to either inbox.\n\n[!info] Regarding gazingintoquantumstars\nThe archive, gazingintoquantumstars, is a sideblog where I reblog memes/prompts/etc to in order to reblog a smaller selection to my roleplay blog.\nIf you can't find anything in my rp blog's prompts tag that strikes your fancy, try the sideblog instead, as there is a wider selection there, and is broken down even further by types of prompts/memes than simply IC or OOC like my roleplay blog's tags.\n\nInclude Full Prompt When Sending\nI am not always able to fill memes and/or prompts right away, so please be sure to include the full prompt when sending anything that isn't simply a sentence starter (and/or include a link to the meme itself so I can find it later for the context).\n\n[!guideline] Repeated Emojis &amp; Mistaken Prompts For Sentence Starters\nThis is especially true for emoji memes[3], as well as anything along the lines of &quot;Send 'This is an example' for a starter about whatever the prompt is for&quot; style memes, which are often easily confused for sentence starters if the full prompt isn't included.\nWhen the meme is along the lines of &quot;Send ♥️ for whatever the prompt is for&quot;, please send the whole line of the prompt, as any emoji meme is impossible to track down which one it's for unless received immediately after it posts, and even then, things can easily get mixed up with another recently reblogged prompt.\n\nSend Any Time\nYou do not have to wait for me to be active on the dash to send things! My inbox is always open, unless I have literally turned it off.\nI end up spending a lot of time on mobile, and since I rely heavily on userscripts and stylesheets for tumblr rp, in addition to X-Kit Rewritten, you won't see me making many posts, even OOC ones, from mobile. But I can work on things from mobile and then transcribe them later on the desktop for posting, so please do send me as many things as you want.\n\nShips &amp; Dynamics\nMulti-Shipping\nShips (as well as dynamics) are not Highlanders — there can be more than one. There is no cheating (unless specifically plotted and agreed upon ooc, and even then it is strictly with regards to NPCs and not other people's portrayals, as I am not interested in interacting in most group verses and/or AU scenarios involving multiple muns in a shared verse setting[4]).\nChemistry\nChemistry is paramount when it comes to shipping and many dynamics. This can be achieved through in character interactions and/or out of character plotting and approved headcanons, but it still needs to exist.\nFlirting ≠ Forced Shipping\nWhile I'm always willing to test the waters with letting the characters have some flirtatious banter, progressing into anything remotely serious between them needs to have chemistry, whether it is built in and/or out of character.\nYour muse can always flirt with mine, but that doesn't mean it will always be reciprocated (or that they even recognize they're being flirted with — some can be a bit oblivious on that front).\nDynamics\nPlatonic\nPlatonic dynamics are still chemistry based for progression — strangers, acquaintances, casual friends, coworkers, family, etc. are all baseline starting points for platonic dynamics, but the deeper the connection, the more important chemistry becomes.\nQueerplatonic\nQueerplatonic[5] dynamics are welcome, and are dependent on chemistry in much the same way of romantic dynamics. This goes beyond being close friends and/or even best friends, and is very much akin to what you'd expect from romantic dynamics, but without the actual romance side of things.\nFamilial\nFamilial dynamics (whether by blood, by choice, by circumstance, found family, team as family, etc.) are welcome, and are chemistry based as everything else is. Non-canon children of any muse will require ooc discussion, though I am extremely selective when it comes to interacting with such muses (it's not to say I won't, but I've had some bad experiences with it in the past, so I'm much more picky about it now).\nAntagonistic\nAntagonistic dynamics (where the intention is for them to stay that way for the long term, as with villains and such) are welcome, but may require ooc discussion and plotting to establish boundaries and the like — especially if there's any sexual encounters involved in the dynamic.\nShipping\nRomanic Ships\nRomantic ships are strictly chemistry based — if the muses don't have chemistry, then a romantic ship isn't likely to develop. At least not without more plotting, and may require a soft reset of their interactions to try again.\nSexual Ships\nSexual ships — which may be independent of a romantic ship, in cases of more casual sexual dynamics — are also reliant on chemistry for actual progression, though this may be less necessary for more casual sexual encounters than for other sexual dynamics.\nSmut\nNo Ship/Dynamic Required To Start — While I am open to writing smut, it is not my primary focus. But some of my muses are open to more casual sexual encounters than others, so it's not impossible to have smut be a part of the muses' dynamics without there being a need for anything beyond mutual agreement to test things out through in character interactions.\n\n[!guideline] Spicy Prompts Open To All Mutuals\nThis can be done simply my sending a prompt/meme from the ones tagged as &quot;Spicy&quot;, for both in and/or out of character responses.\nSending such is not considered forced shipping — if I don't feel we're quite there yet, I will simply let the ask hang out in the inbox until a more suitable time to answer it.\n\nVerses &amp; AUs\nSpecify Verse\nTBA\nPrivate Verses &amp; AUs\nPrivate Verses &amp; AUs are largely reserved for Mains, Best Friends Call Members, and partners with whom I'm shipping with and/or our muses have strong dynamics together.\nGenerally speaking, if I'm likely to want and/or need to have room to where I can make notes to track progression of the pairing's dynamics together, then I'll probably tag it as a private verse and have dedicated note pages to keep track of such things on here.\nInteracting In Other Muns' Private Verses &amp; AUs\nIt is exceptionally rare that I am willing to let anyone other than the intended partner interact within any private verses, largely due to the fact that even mutual mutuals can one day not be mutuals anymore, and so there is the matter of untangling the mess then when it comes to dissolving those connections.\nAs such, private verses are most likely available only for their intended partner that is actively mentioned in the verse's tag itself.\n\nPlotting\nImprov Roleplay\nI am very much an improv roleplayer. While I can handle doing some loose plotting to help guide the overall intended path of a dynamic and/or ship, I work best with minimal prompting and simply letting inspiration lead where it may.\nPlotting\nStrict Plottiers\n\n[!rule]+ Incompatible Partner for Strict Plotters\nPlotting, for me, cannot be a strict railroaded outline — doing such means my brain will decide it's already been written, and the only way it can be written again is with changes and divergences made to it.\nIf you are someone who needs to have strict plotting to know exactly where things begin, end, and everything that happens in between, we are not going to be compatible with each other.\n\nAdditional Guidelines\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/additional-guidelines/interaction-forms-guidelines/\">Interaction Forms - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/additional-guidelines/interest-tracking-forms-guidelines/\">Interest Tracking Forms - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Mods &amp; Expanded Canon - Guidelines</a>\n\nFandom-Specific Rules\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/additional-guidelines/fandom-specific-guidelines/baldur-s-gate-guidelines/\">!

These codes will be made available in the near future for everyone else to have access to as well.\n\nText Formatting\nWhat I use for formatting versus what I actually see on my display is not always the same thing, thanks to the stylesheets and userscripts I use. Tumblr's default font sizes for both regular and small text are uncomfortable for me to read, so I have made adjustments to both via stylesheets.\n\nFormatting\nStyle Used By Ziggy\nAccessibility?\n\nSpacing\nSingle Spaced Only\nUserscript\n\nText Size\nTumblr Default + Small Text for inline footnotes.\nStylesheet\n\nFont Style\nTumblr Default\nStylesheet\n\nFont Color\nTumblr Default\nStylesheet\n\nOther Post Details\nIn terms of icons and graphics, I don't care what others use, unless you make a habit of using flashing gifs, at which point I may not be able to interact with you if it proves to be a problem with my migraines.\nIn terms of the actual text, please be sure to use proper paragraph breaks and sentence case, as the lack of such often makes it impossible for me to read, between the constant low level headaches that I have (not including the migraine spikes), and the ADHD making large single blocks of text often impossible to keep up with where I am in them.[3]\n\nDetail\nStyle Used By Ziggy\nAccessibility?\n\nIcons\nNone Used\nn/a\n\nGraphics\nBanners &amp; Dividers\nn/a\n\nParagraph Length\nTypically 4 to 6 lines, minus inline footnotes\nn/a\n\nCase (ie Capitalisation)\nProper Sentence Case\n(working on it)\n\nVerses &amp; AUs\n\n[!rule]+ Fandom Matched By Default\nI will typically match fandom to fandom, so whatever fandom your muse is being written in the setting of, I will use my corresponding verse and/or AU that matches that fandom. If I don't have an established verse already, I may create one for your muse's fandom, in either the Fandom Specific AUs and/or Trapped In Another World AUs variants.\n\n[!guideline]+ Mix &amp; Match Fandoms On Request\nI am open to playing with mix &amp; match fandom selections, so if you want to explore a specific fandom setting with our muses from any combination of their available verses and AUs, then all you have to do is ask. The answer will almost always be &quot;yes&quot;, so long as I'm even remotely familiar with the fandom you want to set things in.\n\nTypes of Available Verses &amp; AUs\nCanon-Based Verses &amp; AUs\n\nIncludes Canon Typical &amp; Canon Divergent AUs\nThese are the standard verses that take place within the muse's origin fandom universe, whether sticking closer to whatever the muse's personal canon (ie Canon Typical) is, or being an alternate variant of such (ie Canon Divergent AUs)\n\nFandom Specific AUs\n\nIncludes various crossover AUs\nThese verses are where my muse's backstory typically is rewritten to fit them appropriately into another fandom's universe, as if they were native to that universe instead of their origin fandom — in other words: just like anyone else's Fandom AUs\n\nTrapped In Another World AUs\n\nIncludes various universe displacement AUs\nTypically verses where my muse finds themselves in another fandom's universe by one means or another, and their (likely impossible) mission to find a way back home while trying to survive in an unfamiliar world.\n\nOther Verses &amp; AUs\n\nMostly future proofing\nOccasional verses/AUs that just don't quite fit into the other categories.\nMay include any purely multifandom verses &amp;/or AUs.\n\nPrivate Verses &amp; AUs\n\nIncludes private Dynamic/Ship Verses &amp; AUs — not limited to romantic shipping\nMost commonly reserved for Mains, Best Friends Call Members, &amp; shipping partners\nOften plotted verses/AUs &amp; dynamics/ships, so if we've done a lot of plotting, or have developed dynamics/ships, I may switch the interactions to private verses so that I can more easily keep separate notes for the progression of the interactions and any verse/interactions specific divergences and/or plotting that we've established.\n\nFollowing &amp; Unfollowing\nTBA\n\nBlocking\nTBA\n\nRandom Vaguely Related Things\nCorrections Needed\nIf you notice broken links, typos, grammar mistakes, etc., absolutely let me know! I run on a perpetual negative spoons in terms of energy available, so it can take me hours, days, or even months to notice something is off. I will not be upset with you for telling me that there is a technical issue that is in need of being fixed — just be polite about it.\nLack Of Information\nIf there's a muse/verse/etc. you want more info on, tell me. I struggle to find focus where getting everything filled in is concerned, when the only thing I have to go by is how much interaction any given character is getting and in what verse(s). So those things inadvertently get prioritised, while everything else is sidelined initially, which I am aware can lead to people being hesitant to interact with it then.\nBut if I don't know there's any active interest in it, I don't know to actually try to focus on it. So ask questions. Request that I get the info up here on the site. I want to get everything available, but I'm already working at a disadvantage thanks to AuDHD and my chronic illnesses, so knowing there's interest will help give me direction when I actually feel up to working on things.\n\nThat don't fall into the realm of &quot;being a dick&quot; — any and all anon hate is screen capped and mocked privately with my friends, while the messages themselves are blocked and/or reported. ↩︎\n\nI hold off on filling these until I'm certain I'm not going to be sending any other asks so I may send up to 10 at one time. I do not expect you to answer all of them, especially not all at once - I am only trying to provide you with options and variety. Feel free to delete anything you're not interested in doing. ↩︎\n\nThis is made even worse when there is a lack of proper sentence case and punctuation, though I can usually tolerate it so long as paragraph breaks are used properly. ↩︎",
