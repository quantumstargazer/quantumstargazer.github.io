		"content": "Open Muses Roster\n\n[!rule]- Interest Assumed Unless Told Otherwise\nUnless you tell me you're not interested in them by filling out the (Dis)Interest Tracker form, then these are the muses who I am more likely to throw your way at random, from any of their canon-based verses and/or fandom matched AUs (ie I will match your muse's fandom with a verse/AU of my own for that muse, regardless of the muse's origin fandom — so if you write Dragon Age, I may send a Baldur's Gate and/or Mass Effect muse your way, but it will be from one of their corresponding Dragon Age verses/AUs, not their respective canon-based verses).\n\n[!FAQ]- What Are Open Muses?\nOpen Muses are my primary muses, though that does not mean that they share the same activity level, as I base that off of fandom more than individual muse, as it tends to vary drastically, plus all of my muses have AUs for all of my primary fandoms. So while a muse's fandom might be tertiary in terms of activity, their verses/AUs for the primary fandom would likely have higher activity.\n\nBaldur's Gate\nTavares Umbrafae\n\n[!profile]+ Tavares Umbrafae\nHalf-Fey Aevendrow — Wintertouched Long Night Scion — Misfortune Bringer\n\nTavares Umbrafae is an archfey warlock in service of the Prince of Frost, tasked with bringing misfortune to Faerûn in exchange for being allowed to return to the material plane after &quot;seven years and a day&quot; that proved to have lasted decades longer than were claimed.\nExiled from her home in Callidae when she returned decades after her disappearance, her pact to the Pale Prince clear with the binding marks she soon learns to hide with a glamour, she ventures out of the frozen north in search of her Prince's consort and to fulfill her assigned duties.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/baldur-s-gate/tavares-umbrafae/summary-tavares/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nWishlists\n\nFaeynore Moonstar\n\n[!profile]+ Faeynore Moonstar\nMoon Elf — Private Investigator &amp; Spirit Medium — College of Glamour Bard\n\nFaeynore Moonstar is a private investigator out of Baldur's Gate, where she has often aided defendants in proving their innocence before the magistrates - including Magistrate Astarion Ancunín before his death some two centuries prior.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/baldur-s-gate/faeynore-moonstar/summary-faeynore/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nWishlists\n\nDirge\n\n[!profile]+ Dirge\nGold Dwarf — College of Spirits Bard — Way of the Long Death Monk\n\nUnable to recall their life from before the nautiloid, they only know their name is The Dark Urge, that they are a bardic monk, and that everyone would look so much better as a pretty corpse...\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/baldur-s-gate/dirge/summary-dirge/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nWishlists\n\nDragon Age\nAshina de Riva née Tabris\n\n[!profile]+ Ashina de Riva\nCity Elf — ~~Grey Wardens (defected) Antivan Crows — Master Assassin\n\nAshina is conscripted against her will into the Grey Wardens at the start of the Fifth Blight in 9:30 Dragon, going by the name of &quot;Tathas Arainai&quot;. By 9:31 Dragon, she is notorious among the Wardens for having survived killing the archdemon and ending the Blight, only then to encounter the darkspawn magister known only as the Architect several months later, and letting it live. The First Warden issued orders for her to be brought in — alive — to Weisshaupt for questioning. No warden has survived the attempt until she is said to have been killed by the Antivan Crows in 9:33 Dragon.\nIn 9:33 Dragon, Ashina enters negotiations with the Fifth Talon of House de Riva, seeking protection from the Grey Wardens in exchange for her service to the House and the Crows. She is now a Master Assassin of House de Riva, and may serve as the Fifth Talon's Second.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/summary-ashina/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/connections-ashina/\">Connections</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/headcanons-ashina/\">Headcanons</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/wishlists-ashina/\">Wishlists</a>\n\nZaehire de Riva\n\n[!profile]+ Zaehire de Riva\nCasteless Royal Bastard Dwarf — Antivan Crows — Assassin Duelist\n\nPurchased by a House Arainai from her noble hunter mother in Orzammar mere days after her birth, Zaehire is raised from infancy to be a Crow. She is later freed from House Arainai by the Black Shadow, who aids her in getting as far as Salle, where she is taken in by House de Riva.\nAs a fledgling of House de Riva, Zaehire becomes Viago's protégé, as well as an occasional thorn in his side with her impulsiveness. And yet she often manages to turn those impulsive tendencies into boons for House de Riva, such as when she manages to negotiate her way into acting as a liaison between the House and the Carta, securing a steady supply of lyrium for de Riva's mages, and ensuring Carta assassins don't interfere in de Riva contracts.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/zaehire-de-riva/summary-zaehire/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nWishlists\n\nLeonardo de Riva\n\n[!profile]+ Leonardo de Riva\nHuman Noble Orphan Mage — Antivan Crows — Spellblade Assassin\n\nLeonardo was the third son of a minor noble family in Salle, Antiva — a noble family that was desperately hiding its destitution from the rest of society. In 9:36, his parents and two older brothers are killed by Antivan Crows, and he is instead taken into House de Riva.\nWhen he is first brought into the House, he begins training as a rogue, only for his magic to make itself known many weeks later. He doesn't give up on his rogue training, insisting that he can manage both it and his magical training, and while many expected him to fail, his sheer determination to prove himself worthy of being a de Riva leads to his eventually studying to be a Spellblade Assassin.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/leonardo-de-riva/summary-leonardo/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nWishlists\n\nWard Ingellvar\n\n[!profile]+ Ward Ingellvar\nSpirit of Learning Elf — Mourn Watch — Mortalitasi Death Caller\n\nWard Ingellvar is a foundling of the Necropolis, discovered deep within the lower levels of the Grand Necropolis as an infant by benevolent undead, who informed Vorgoth of the child's presence where few dared to venture. Sensing the truth of the elven infant's origins, Vorgoth decides to take them as their own ward, especially as superstitions arise from the child's unexplained appearance in the Grand Necropolis. As Vorgoth's ward, the elven child is raised within the Necropolis and the Mourn Watch. They are quiet and often reserved, preferring the company of spirits and the benevolent undead to that of most of the living.\n.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ward-ingellvar/summary-ward/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nWishlists\n\nZevran Arainai\n\n[!profile]+ Zevran Arainai\nCity Elf — Antivan Crows — Master Assassin — Eighth Talon [1]\n\nIn 9:45 Dragon, Zevran takes advantage of the chaos among the Houses with half of their Talons dead — including the Eighth Talon of House Arainai — and thus he claims the House and the position for himself, deciding that the only way the House is ever truly going to change is if they are destroyed completely, or he takes control of them himself.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/zevran-arainai/summary-zevran/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nWishlists\n\nHaleir Lavellan\n\n[!profile]+ Haleir Lavellan\nDalish Exile Elf — Inquisition Followers of Fen'Harel — Inquisitor Agent of Fen'Harel\n\nIn 9:44 Dragon, Haleir abandons the Inquisition after learning who Solas truly is, instead joining him and his cause, following him through the eluvian.\n.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/haleir-lavellan/summary-haleir/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nWishlists\n\nBertrand Ingellvar\n\n[!profile]+ Bertrand Ingellvar\nQunari — Mourn Watch — Grand Necropolis Reaper Guard\n\nA foundling of the Grand Necropolis, Bertrand was raised within the Mourn Watch, and despite not having the magical talent needed to be a necromancer, he is still a skilled Watcher, though he mostly serves as a guard in the Necropolis.\n.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/bertrand-ingellvar/summary-bertrand/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nWishlists\n\nMass Effect\nIsabela Shepard\n\n[!profile]+ Isabela Shepard\nHuman Biotic — Paragade — Council Spectre — Infiltration Saboteur Engineer\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

She specialises in contracts for entire noble households, methodically wiping out an entire family line and their house in a single evening.\nWhile it is known among the Crows that she is also a Grey Warden, few outside of a handful of Talons and other high ranking Crows know that she is, in fact, the notorious Hero of Ferelden, widely known as &quot;Warden Tathas&quot;, who joined the Antivan Crows in 9:33 Dragon to escape from Weisshaupt and the First Warden's orders that she be brought in for questioning regarding her surviving killing an archdemon.\n\n[!info]- Verse Navigation\n\nDossier\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/headcanons-ashina/#dragon-age-headcanons\">Headcanons</a>\nVerse\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/wishlists-ashina/#dragon-age-wishlists\">Wishlists</a>\n\nCanon Divergent AUs\n\n[!verse]+ Rook\n\nDefaults to Veilguard timeline. (9:50 - 9:54 Dragon)\n\nOne thing Ashina can never turn her back on is slavery, especially after the incident in the Denerim Alienage during the Fifth Blight, so there was simply no way she was going to ignore the Antaam slavers, especially when she spotted one of her own friends in their cages — not even to report in to her Talon for instruction.\nHer actions disrupt the Talons' plans — plans she hadn't been at all aware of — and as a result, she is sent on an extended contract to hunt the Dread Wolf when Varric Tethras shows up requesting her help in stopping Solas from destroying the world.\n\n[!info]- Verse Navigation\n\nDossier\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/headcanons-ashina/#rook-headcanons\">Headcanons</a>\nVerse\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/wishlists-ashina/#rook-wishlists\">Wishlists</a>\n\n[!verse]+ Inquisitor\n\nDefaults to Inquisition timeline. (9:40 - 9:44 Dragon)\n\nAshina hadn't wanted anything to do with the Divine's Conclave, nor the Mage-Templar conflict, but she has no choice when the First Talon orders her to go spy on the meetings. When she finds signs of a Grey Warden presence at the Conclave, she knows something isn't right, and heads to where she suspects the records might be kept to check the list of expected attendees, only to stumble across the Warden mages in the middle of a blood magic ritual, and the Divine their intended sacrifice.\nWhen Ashina wakes up in the dungeon under Haven's chantry with now real memory of what happened at the temple, and a magical hole in her hand, she dreads having to send word back to the Talons to provide her report and try to explain how a Master Assassin is being accused of murdering the Divine, and worse still, once the Breach is calmed, is being called the Herald of Andraste.\n\n[!info]- Verse Navigation\n\nDossier\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/headcanons-ashina/#inquisitor-headcanons\">Headcanons</a>\nVerse\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/wishlists-ashina/#inquisitor-wishlists\">Wishlists</a>\n\n[!verse]+ Inquisitor Crow\n\nDefaults to Inquisition timeline.

The city guard arrive shortly after the elves do, so Ashina claims sole responsibility for the slaughter at the practice and is immediately arrested and thrown into the palace dungeons for the Arl to decide her fate once he returns from Ostagar.\nAshina has no intention of staying in the dungeons, waiting to be executed, so she looks for any way she can to escape her cell.

Despite their unusual circumstances, they are likely the only one in the world who has even a chance of convincing Solas to change his plans, and so they are given the nigh impossible task of getting close to the Dread Wolf and try to convince him that this world is worth living in.\n\n[!info]- Verse Navigation\n\nDossier\nHeadcanons\nVerse\nWishlist\n\n[!verse]+ Ancient Times\n\nTime Travel AU\n\nWhen Solas is bound to the Veil, magic goes wild once it's faced with the spirit he had inadvertently bound to him with blood magic during his initial ritual to tear down the Veil.

		"url":"/",
		"content": "Quantum Stargazer Wiki\n\n[!error] Under Emergency Construction\nSite is under emergency construction after the old wiki decided to start suffering from fatal errors on the host's end, so things are going to be a bit chaotic while I try to salvage the data from the old site to add to this one. Please be patient, as I am chronically ill and unable to always dedicate a lot of time and energy to this effort.\n\n[!WARNING] Testing In Progress\nGreat work. Because this message is prerecorded, any observations related to your performance are speculation on our part. Please disregard any undeserved compliments.\n\nQuantum Stargazer\nQuantum Stargazer is an Independent, Selective, 21+ &amp; Mutuals Only Multifandom Multimuse blog featuring canon, canon-based, and original characters from Baldur's Gate[1], Dragon Age, Mass Effect, &amp; more.\nRP Info\n\nMulti-Ship - Ships are not Highlanders — there can be more than one. And there will be. There will be.\nMulti-Verse - All <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses-roster/\">Open Muses</a> have Canon-Based Verses, Fandom Specific AUs, Trapped In Another World AUs, &amp;/or Other Verses &amp; AUs.\nExtremely Crossover Friendly - If a verse &amp;/or doesn't exist, so long as I'm even remotely familiar with and interested in the fandom, chances are good that I'll add a verse to make it happen.\nLoose Plotting Only - Not a heavy or strict planner; if you are, then I'm probably not who you want to try to plot with.\nIn Character Posts Immediately - IC posts are never queued — only prompts, memes, aesthetics, etc. are queued.\n\n[!ziggy]- Wordy AF - Unapologetically Neurodivergent\nAuDHD means infodumping is likely to occur, and this means my posts, as well as the notes here, are likely to get wordy. I tend to try to be mindful of individual paragraph lengths, but there will often be a lot of paragraphs and/or bullet points.\nIf, for any reason, you are troubled by being expected to actually read things in a writing hobby that should, in theory, require at least 50% reading, considering it's collaborative nature, then I'm probably not the roleplay partner for you.\n\nThread Tracking\n\n[!tracker]- Important Note About Thread Tracking\nI do not use the RP Thread Tracker quite as intended. Most notably where the Archive and Queue is concerned.\n\nAny in character post tagged with &quot;; partnerurl / partnermuse &amp; my muse / 000&quot; is intended to be added to the tracker — Havu (lanternlit) is helping to make sure everything actually gets tracked.\nOnly active threads are in the front most view, so I can keep tabs what I currently have going on — anything else is either marked as Archived or Queued for storage purposes.\n\nThreads Inactive For Longer Than 2+ Months\n\nThreads that have been on &quot;their turn&quot; for 2+ months are sent to the Archive for storage until it is replied to — these threads are still accessible through the public view's dropdown menu to access Archived threads.\n\nI do not consider these threads dropped unless I have updated the title to mark them as such. If you have outright dropped a thread, please notify me directly. This can be done through discord, tumblr IM, and/or the tumblr inbox.\n\nThreads that have been on my turn for 2+ months are potentially sent to the Queue for storage if they're stuck in drafts due to low muse activity — again, they're still accessible through the dropdown menu to access Queued threads.\n\nThese posts are not actually queued, however, as I never queue in character posts. It is just a functional way of setting them aside in the tracker so as not to overwhelm me when I know I'm not going to be replying to that post for a while, and it should automatically release it from being marked as queued when I do eventually get it posted.\nLikewise, these threads are also not dropped — some muses, or even just some verses for that muse, are simply slower than others, and so interactions may go months without being replied to if I have little to no muse for them at the time.\n\nWhere You Can See What's Tracked\n\nThread Tracker - all threads, regardless of whose turn it is\nZiggy’s Turn - my turns only\n\n[!guideline]- Regarding Tracking &amp; Dropped Threads\nI very rarely drop threads myself simply due to a lack of interest, so this is not something you need to worry about, even if it takes me a long time to reply to a thing. I will get to it eventually, or I will reach out and let you know that I need to drop it because I'm unable to find a way to continue it.\nIf you lose interest in a thread, please just let me know so I can mark it as dropped &amp;/or ended, rather than letting it sit as being archived and still waiting for a potential reply to come in. I'm an avid reader of work-in-progress fics on AO3 — I will wait literal years for a continuation.\nIf you're never going to reply to something, I'd rather just know rather than being expected to assume — assumptions make asses out of people, more often than not, and again, I'm neurodivergent AF and disabled, so my assumptions are always going to lean to the far kinder &quot;they're probably just busy/too tired/brainfoggy/etc&quot; side of things rather than &quot;oh, they've lost interest and I should move on from that thread&quot; that most neurotypical people assume.\n\nInterest Forms\n\n[!rule]- Interest Assumed For All Open Muses\nUnless you fill out the (Dis)Interest Tracker to tell me otherwise, if we're mutuals, it's assumed you're interested in interacting with any and all of my Open Muses in any of their canon-based verses and/or their fandom matched verses &amp; AUs.\n\n(Dis)Interest Tracker - for telling me who you are &amp;/or are not interested in interacting with\nRP Preferences Tracker - for telling me your preferences for interactions, plotting, etc. (Coming Soon)\nBest Friends Call - the closest thing I have to a 'permanent starter call' with benefits\n\nInteractions Calls\n\n[!guideline]- Request Interaction At Any Time\nThese forms are here to let you request interaction at any time, whether I'm actively on the dash or not (I lurk way more than it appears, since I don't really post from mobile, but I do read and draft things while afk from my desktop).\n\nStarter Call - for requesting that I write a starter for your muse(s)\nInbox Call - for requesting that I send prompts/memes to your inbox\n\nRules &amp; Guidelines\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/actual-rules/\">The Actual Rules</a> - must be read before following\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/guidelines/\">RP Guidelines</a> - may not apply to everyone\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/rp-faq/\">Frequently Asked Questions</a> - answers to common things that have come up over the years\n\nMuse Rosters\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses-roster/\">Open Muses</a> - priority muses — available to everyone\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/by-request-only-roster/\">By Request Only</a> - available only on request\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/friends-only-roster/\">Friends Only</a> - by invitation only\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/irregulars-roster/\">Irregulars</a> - available only for Mains &amp; Best Friends Call Members\n\nAbout the Mun\n\nname/alias: Ziggy\npronouns: they/them\nage: 40+\n\n[!example]+ Fandoms\n\nBaldur's Gate[1:1] - secondary — moderate activity\nDragon Age - primary — high activity\nMass Effect - tertiary — low activity\n\n[!todo]- Other Fandoms\nThis is not an extensive list of fandoms I'm interested in &amp;/or familiar with enough to roleplay with. Please note: I don't keep up well with modern media, so don't expect me to be familiar with new things as soon as they come out.\n\nAddams Family\nDC (focus: Batman: The Animated Series)\nDetroit: Become Human\nDoctor Who (Expanded Universe)\nDungeons &amp; Dragons (tabletop rpg)\nElder Scrolls\nFallout\nForgotten Realms (D&amp;D setting)\nGhostbusters (focus: The Real Ghostbusters)[2]\nMarvel (focus: Iron Man/Tony Stark)[3]\nOur Flag Means Death\nStar Trek\nStardew Valley\nSupernatural\n\nIncorporates Forgotten Realms and D&amp;D/AD&amp;D lore for individual characters as needed, mostly through BG3 mods, but occasionally just additional lore needed to further flesh out the characters. ↩︎ ↩︎\n\nWhen I am writing Peter Venkman, he is not the movie-verse Venkman, but rather the further developed characterization from The Real Ghostbusters (ie the sharp minded businessman who has a soft spot for kids and little old ladies who remind him of his mom) and it is extremely important that this is respected — failure to do so will likely result in the interactions being dropped. ↩︎\n\nMostly the Marvel Cinematic Universe, prior to Avengers: Infinity War. In terms of my portrayal of Tony Stark, his MCU canon stops at Captain America: Civil War, where it then goes fully AU with dimensional travel and franchise swap, as he will be written as part of the DC universe, primarily focused on that of Batman: The Animated Series (as well as most of the animated movies), in addition to some fanmade content to be detailed in Tony's info once I'm ready to actually start writing him again. ↩︎",

		"url":"/rules-and-guidelines/actual-rules/",
		"content": "The Actual Rules\n\n[!attention]- Read Rules Before Following\nI actively block people who obviously did not read my rules before following me first — typically for their being under the age of 21, and/or their blog containing banned content such as fandoms, faceclaims, &amp;/or tropes &amp; themes.\n\nDon't Be A Dick\nThis should got without saying, and yet...[1]\n21+ &amp; Mutuals Only\n\n[!caution]- Viewer Discretion Is Advised\nMost of my fandoms are literally rated M for Mature Audiences, and as such my blogs and wiki are rated the same. See <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/additional-faq/mature-audiences-only-faq/\">Mature Audiences Only - FAQ</a> for additional information, including a list of content that you may need to be aware of regarding squicks and triggers.\n\n[!rule]- Must Be 18+ To Follow\nI hard block any minors — as well as any blogs who do not list an age at all — who follow me. I do not roleplay with anyone under the age of 21, however, so if you are 18 to 20, you are welcome to follow, but I will not be writing with you until you are at least 21.\n\nIf you don't have an age range that actively states you are at least 21+ listed on your blog and/or in your rules, I will not follow you, nor will I write roleplay with you. I am in my early 40s, and just simply do not wish to write with anyone younger than US drinking age at this point.\nCurate Your Own Dash\n\n[!fail]- Regarding Others' &quot;Dead Dove: Do Not Eat&quot; Warnings\nI do not follow anyone whose only warnings for their blog consists of &quot;Dead Dove&quot; without covering what topics, themes, tropes, etc. are likely to be found on the blog. And given that I typically block blogs with explicit roleplayed scenes involving rape, sexual assault, Alpha/Beta/Omega dynamics, etc., if &quot;Dead Dove: Do Not Eat&quot; is the only warning you provide, then I'm going to assume that's what you write, and will proceed to curate my own dash accordingly.\nWithout any explanation, it's as effective as saying &quot;Warning: Consider Yourself Warned&quot; while inviting people to potentially walk into a nuclear reactor.\n\nDon't Like? Don't Follow.\nIf you don't like me, my muses, my verses, my blog, etc., then just don't follow me — in fact, if you feel that strongly about any of these things, you should probably hard block me and keep me blocked [2] instead, so as to keep my content off your dash.\nHard Block Only - No Soft Block\nIf you feel the need to block me at all for any reason, hard block me, even if you typically only soft block. I am unable to reliably remember if someone has simply soft blocked me instead, and may refollow if I find your blog again in the future, being completely unable to remember that I had followed you in the past. [2:1]\nBanned &amp; Restricted Content\nTropes &amp; Themes\n\n[!danger]+ Banned Tropes &amp; Themes — No Follow &amp;/or Interaction\n\nsexual content with any muse &amp;/or faceclaim under the age of 18\nscenes involving explicit acts of rape/noncon, sexual assault, sexual violence, etc.\nscenes involving sexual abuse, up to and including incest, pedophilia, etc.\nanything involving Alpha/Beta/Omega (Omegaverse) dynamics &amp;/or settings\n\n[!warning]+ Restricted Tropes &amp; Themes\n\nmagic anons of any kind\nscenes involving pregnancy complications, miscarriage, infant death, etc.\nscenes involving active labor and/or childbirth [3]\n\nFandoms\n\n[!danger]+ Banned Fandoms — No Follow &amp;/or Interaction\n\nHarry Potter &amp; Related Fandoms (JK Rowling) [4]\nThe Boys (2019)\n\nFaceclaims\n\n[!danger]+ Faceclaims — No Follow &amp;/or Interaction\n\nAlexandra Daddario\nAnna Speckhart\nAnya Taylor-Joy\nKayla Scodelario\nEline Powell\nJessica Chastain\nModels\n\n[!warning]+ Restricted Faceclaims\n\nMusicians [5]\nYoutubers [5:1]\n\nAdditional Guidelines May Apply\nBecause the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/guidelines/\">Guidelines</a> are not entirely universal, depending on which fandoms someone is or isn't interested in, how they may wish to interact (for example: whether or not they have any interest in shipping), etc., these are listed separate from the actual rules.\nThat said, when the guidelines do apply to you, they are considered rules for you, though I may be more willing to make exceptions on an individual basis, but this should not be considered the standard, nor should it be expected of me. It is extremely rare that I make exceptions for anyone, but it has been known to happen occasionally.\n\nGiven that I only write with those who are 21 years or older, if you've reached that point of your life and still don't know how to be a decent human being, then I truly would rather you go elsewhere, because I don't have the time nor the energy to deal with that kind of bullshit. ↩︎\n\nI have severe memory issues due to various comorbid medical conditions, including a traumatic brain injury, so I sincerely cannot be relied on to remember if you merely unfollowed &amp;/or soft blocked me. It is for the best that I simply remain blocked, and that if you move to a new blog in the future, especially if you change your username, that you continue to block me from the new blog(s) as well. ↩︎ ↩︎\n\nIf pregnancy becomes a part of any interaction, the active labor and childbirth will be time skipped to when the baby has arrived and has been cleaned up — no exceptions. ↩︎\n\nI don't care how anti-JK Rowling you are — I will not follow or interact with you if you have any Harry Potter muses or verses/AUs on your blog. If we are mutuals, and you add such muses and/or verses/AUs in the future, I will break mutual status by hard blocking you. There will be no exceptions to this rule. ↩︎\n\nIf they have genuine face acting roles, such as would be the case with someone like David Bowie in Labyrinth (1986), then they're fine. Cameos do not count, especially in the case of Youtubers. ↩︎ ↩︎",

They are not just for new mutuals and/or people who haven't started interacting yet.\nFill out the interest forms - This will make interactions go a lot more smoothly all around, truly.\nTake inspiration from my AUs - I'm a firm supporter of transformative works, so absolutely take inspiration from my work.\nAsk questions about my muses, their verses, &amp;/or AUs - I'm always happy to ramble about things to satisfy others' curiosity about these things.\nRead the muse &amp; verse info - This is really important, since while I say things are &quot;canon-typical&quot;, that does not mean they're canon-compliant. I don't expect you to remember each and every little detail, but some things are big enough to throw things off course if you assume it's the same as in canon when it's not. A &quot;Quick Guide To Interactions&quot; is added to the bottom of all dossiers and verse details to assist with this.\nAsk to start over - If you're not happy with the direction things are going in within our interactions, feel free to ask to start over. We can plot things out a little to figure out the direction to move things in from there.\nTell me if you want to ship - I ship with chemistry, but that doesn't mean I can't handle hearing your wants for a future ship and/or dynamic. It just gives us something to build towards if we're both mutually interested in the same thing there.\nScream at me in discord at all ungodly hours - Seriously, I rarely sleep, so chances are online anyway, regardless of what timezone you're in.\nRandomly drop plot ideas on me whenever - Just be forewarned that I may take them and turn them into a starter with little to no further enabling.\nLike and comment and subscribe on headcanons or thoughts about muses - This will truly make my day.\n\nThings You Should NOT Do\n\nDon't be a dick - This is ultimately what all of the rules &amp; guidelines boil down to.\nDon't send anonymous hate - Anon is a privilege, not a right. I keep it on for prompts/memes, and the socially anxious. Not for dicks to be assholes. If you send anon hate, know that it will be screencapped and shared and mocked in private among my friends, while the ask itself will be reported to tumblr for harassment.\nDon't follow without at least reading the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/actual-rules/\">Actual Rules</a> bits - Seriously, this has become that much of an issue...\nDon't interact without reading the rules &amp; guidelines - It will inevitably become obvious you didn't read them, and chances are that I will likely simply block you, depending on the severity of the lines crossed as a result.\nDon't assume I am my muses - Honestly, just read this psa for more on this one.\nDon't reblog things you're not a part of - This especially goes for roleplay threads, &quot;missing scenes&quot; (ficlets that are tied to specific ships &amp;/or dynamics), headcanons, verse details, etc. If you're not actively tagged in them, they are not for you to reblog without my express permission.\nDon't use my blog as your resource - I'm good at finding cool shit, but please reblog from the source and/or the sideblogs that I myself am most likely reblogging from, rather than spamming my roleplay notifications. Mutuals actively interacting with me have more leeway and can reblog directly from me, just don't go overboard.\nDon't feed my writing into any AI - This is theft and a blatant copyright violation, and you will be blocked and reported.\nDon't use AI to write &amp;/or create images for me - I want to be creative with people, not machines.\nDon't softblock me — only hardblock if you feel the need to block - If you feel the need to get me off your dash, outright hardblock me. My memory cannot be trusted to remember who to avoid refollowing, so it's better to just outright block me and keep me blocked instead.\nDon't take it personally if I block you - Again, my memory is absolute shit, so I end up blocking liberally for a wide range of reasons, most of which don't have anything to with with the individuals personally.\nDon't assume interactions are in the same universe - Like, sure, between the same muse pairing with the same mun, a lot of them might be, if they're under the same verse tag, at least. But something with Mun A is always in a separate universe from anything with Mun B, unless we're mutual mutuals who have plotted a shared universe together, but those are exceptionally rare cases, and honestly not likely to happen.\nDon't assume anything &amp;/or everything I write is &quot;canon accurate&quot; - I rely heavily on canon divergence, headcanons, mod integration, etc. I enjoy the hell out of a wide range of AUs, crossovers, etc. Canon is my sandbox, and I will destroy and rebuild it as I please.\nDon't panic - And always know where your towel is.",

Muns whom I already ship with - even with other muses that you write - absolutely can include shippy memes in that as well. Just message me before answering anything sexual the first time, since that’s where I’m more highly selective about who I will and won’t write those ships with, yeah? Some on the dash call these &quot;non-negotiable memes&quot;, but of course it's up to you as to whether to accept and/or continue anything sent or received this way. ↩︎",

These guidelines are only an expansion of that and may not apply to everyone, depending on fandoms, interaction preferences, interest in shipping, etc., unlike the rules themselves.\n\nInteractions\nInbox\nYou can send asks/prompts/memes/etc. to the inbox on either quantumstargazer and/or gazingintoquantumstars[1].\nReverse Prompts/Memes\nYou are always welcome to reverse any meme and/or prompts (including sentence starters), simply by stating that you want it reversed, whether the original meme/prompt mentions the option in it or not.\nWe're here to have fun, so if something fits better if it's my muse doing or saying the thing instead of yours (or vise versa, depending on the meme/prompt), then I'm game for flipping the script regardless of what the original meme/prompt poster intended.\nAdding Context To Memes/Prompts\nYou are always welcome to add context and/or expand on any meme and/or prompt (including sentence starters). In fact, it helps a great deal whenever someone does if they have something in particular in mind.\n\n[!guideline] Answered As Text Posts\nAs I always turn asks into text posts rather than publishing the original ask, if you mention you want any part of the ask kept private (do so in the ask itself so that it doesn't get lost in chats), I will simply not copy that part of the message into the text post when I actually publish it.\n\nContinue As Threads\nYou are always welcome to continue answered in character prompts/memes as threads. I answer most asks as new text posts, and will tag these as &quot;Closed Starter&quot;, along with a thread tracking tag[2], if I anticipate it to potentially continued as a thread.\nPrompts Never Expire\nThere is no expiration date on most memes/prompts/etc. (I might side-eye you if you send a winter holiday meme in the middle of summer, though), and they can be found on both quantumstargazer and gazingintoquantumstars, and can be sent to either inbox.\n\n[!info] Regarding gazingintoquantumstars\nThe latter is a sideblog where I reblog memes/prompts/etc to in order to reblog a smaller selection to my roleplay blog.\nIf you can't find anything in my rp blog's prompts tag that strikes your fancy, try the sideblog instead, as there is a wider selection there, and is broken down even further by types of prompts/memes than simply IC or OOC like my roleplay blog's tags.\n\nInclude Full Prompt When Sending\nI am not always able to fill memes and/or prompts right away, so please be sure to include the full prompt when sending anything that isn't simply a sentence starter (and/or include a link to the meme itself so I can find it later for the context).\n\n[!guideline] Repeated Emojis &amp; Mistaken Prompts For Sentence Starters\nThis is especially true for emoji memes[3], as well as anything along the lines of &quot;Send 'This is an example' for a starter about whatever the prompt is for&quot; style memes, which are often easily confused for sentence starters if the full prompt isn't included.\n\nSend Any Time\nYou do not have to wait for me to be active on the dash to send things! My inbox is always open, unless I have literally turned it off.\nI end up spending a lot of time on mobile, and since I rely heavily on userscripts and stylesheets for tumblr rp, in addition to X-Kit Rewritten, you won't see me making many posts, even OOC ones, from mobile. But I can work on things from mobile and then transcribe them later on the desktop for posting, so please do send me as many things as you want.\nStarters\nRequesting Starters\nYou can request for me to write starters for your muses from mine at any time by filling out the Starter Call form linked in the pinned post and/or on the homepage of this site.\n\n[!guideline] Form Required To Request Starters\nThe form is very minimal, but is easier for me to keep track of what has and has not been filled than posts with &quot;like this post for a starter&quot;, especially since I prefer it when people actually specify which muses and/or verses they want starters from.\nThe form does offer a &quot;Ziggy's Choice&quot; option for those who aren't picky and/or are feeling indecisive, though I may be slower to fill such requests if I don't have any direction whatsoever to work from.\n\nRandom Starters\nI do, on occasion, write random, unprompted starters for people, but usually this is reserved for my Mains and the Best Friends Call Members. So if you'd like me to just send stuff at you randomly, please fill out the Best Friends Call form to give me permission to do so.\nShips &amp; Dynamics\nMulti-Shipping\nShips (as well as dynamics) are not Highlanders — there can be more than one. There is no cheating (unless specifically plotted and agreed upon ooc, and even then it is strictly with regards to NPCs and not other people's portrayals, as I am not interested in interacting in most group verses and/or AU scenarios involving multiple muns in a shared verse setting[4]).\nChemistry\nChemistry is paramount when it comes to shipping and many dynamics. This can be achieved through in character interactions and/or out of character plotting and approved headcanons, but it still needs to exist.\nFlirting ≠ Forced Shipping\nWhile I'm always willing to test the waters with letting the characters have some flirtatious banter, progressing into anything remotely serious between them needs to have chemistry, whether it is built in and/or out of character.\nYour muse can always flirt with mine, but that doesn't mean it will always be reciprocated (or that they even recognize they're being flirted with — some can be a bit oblivious on that front).\nDynamics\nPlatonic\nPlatonic dynamics are still chemistry based for progression — strangers, acquaintances, casual friends, coworkers, family, etc. are all baseline starting points for platonic dynamics, but the deeper the connection, the more important chemistry becomes.\nQueerplatonic\nQueerplatonic[5] dynamics are welcome, and are dependent on chemistry in much the same way of romantic dynamics. This goes beyond being close friends and/or even best friends, and is very much akin to what you'd expect from romantic dynamics, but without the actual romance side of things.\nShipping\nRomanic Ships\nRomantic ships are strictly chemistry based — if the muses don't have chemistry, then a romantic ship isn't likely to develop. At least not without more plotting, and may require a soft reset of their interactions to try again.\nSexual Ships\nSexual ships — which may be independent of a romantic ship, in cases of more casual sexual dynamics — are also reliant on chemistry for actual progression, though this may be less necessary for more casual sexual encounters than for other sexual dynamics.\nSmut\nNo Ship/Dynamic Required To Start — While I am open to writing smut, it is not my primary focus. But some of my muses are open to more casual sexual encounters than others, so it's not impossible to have smut be a part of the muses' dynamics without there being a need for anything beyond mutual agreement to test things out through in character interactions.\n\n[!guideline] Spicy Prompts Open To All Mutuals\nThis can be done simply my sending a prompt/meme from the ones tagged as &quot;Spicy&quot;, for both in and/or out of character responses.\nSending such is not considered forced shipping — if I don't feel we're quite there yet, I will simply let the ask hang out in the inbox until a more suitable time to answer it.\n\nVerses &amp; AUs\nPrivate Verses &amp; AUs\nPrivate Verses &amp; AUs are largely reserved for Mains, Best Friends Call Members, and partners with whom I'm shipping with and/or our muses have strong dynamics together.\nGenerally speaking, if I'm likely to want and/or need to have room to where I can make notes to track progression of the pairing's dynamics together, then I'll probably tag it as a private verse and have dedicated note pages to keep track of such things on here.\nInteracting In Other Muns' Private Verses &amp; AUs\nIt is exceptionally rare that I am willing to let anyone other than the intended partner interact within any private verses, largely due to the fact that even mutual mutuals can one day not be mutuals anymore, and so there is the matter of untangling the mess then when it comes to dissolving those connections.\nAs such, private verses are most likely available only for their intended partner that is actively mentioned in the verse's tag itself.\nFandom-Specific Rules\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Baldur's Gate - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Dragon Age - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Mass Effect - Guidelines</a>\n\n[!example]- Other Fandoms - Guidelines\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Doctor Who - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Elder Scrolls - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Fallout - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Stardew Valley - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Star Trek - Guidelines</a>\n\n[!example]- Tertiary Fandoms - Guidelines\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">DC - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Detroit Become Human - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Ghostbusters - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Good Omens - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Marvel - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Our Flag Means Death - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Supernatural - Guidelines</a>\n\nSideblog for archiving any and all of the memes, prompts lists, etc. for personal roleplaying purposes.

Queerplatonic relationships often have characteristics commonly associated with romantic relationships, such as deep emotional intimacy, prioritization, and commitment, while still defying a &quot;platonic or romantic&quot; categorization. Queerplatonic relationships have a flexible dynamic, and each relationship is tailored to the needs of the individuals involved, with no outside societal expectations or guidelines to follow.\nsource: Queerplatonic Relationship - https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Queerplatonic_relationship ↩︎",

		"content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\n[!faq] If You Have Questions, Just Ask!\nYou're always welcome to send any questions you might have[1] for me to my inbox on tumblr.\n\nBlocking\nFollowing &amp; Unfollowing\nPreferences\nPost Formatting\n\n[!warning]- Regarding Accessible Formatting\nI use a series of userscripts and stylesheets to make the tumblr dashboard accessible to me, and without them, I often risk triggering a migraine just by scrolling past certain posts (typically those with double and/or multiple spaced text). These codes will be made available in the near future for everyone else to have access to as well.\n\nText Formatting\nWhat I use for formatting versus what I actually see on my display is not always the same thing, thanks to the stylesheets and userscripts I use. Tumblr's default font sizes for both regular and small text are uncomfortable for me to read, so I have made adjustments to both via stylesheets.\n\nFormatting\nStyle Used By Ziggy\nAccessibility?\n\nSpacing\nSingle Spaced Only\nUserscript\n\nText Size\nTumblr Default + Small Text for inline footnotes.\nStylesheet\n\nFont Style\nTumblr Default\nStylesheet\n\nFont Color\nTumblr Default\nStylesheet\n\nOther Post Details\nIn terms of icons and graphics, I don't care what others use, unless you make a habit of using flashing gifs, at which point I may not be able to interact with you if it proves to be a problem with my migraines.\nIn terms of the actual text, please be sure to use proper paragraph breaks and sentence case, as the lack of such often makes it impossible for me to read, between the constant low level headaches that I have (not including the migraine spikes), and the ADHD making large single blocks of text often impossible to keep up with where I am in them.[2]\n\nDetail\nStyle Used By Ziggy\nAccessibility?\n\nIcons\nNone Used\nn/a\n\nGraphics\nBanners &amp; Dividers\nn/a\n\nParagraph Length\nTypically 4 to 6 lines, minus inline footnotes\nn/a\n\nCase (ie Capitalisation)\nProper Sentence Case\n(working on it)\n\nVerses &amp; AUs\nCanon-Based Verses &amp; AUs\n\nIncludes Canon Typical &amp; Canon Divergent AUs\nThese are the standard verses that take place within the muse's origin fandom universe, whether sticking closer to whatever the muse's personal canon (ie Canon Typical) is, or being an alternate variant of such (ie Canon Divergent AUs)\n\nFandom Specific AUs\n\nIncludes various crossover AUs\nThese verses are where my muse's backstory is rewritten to fit them appropriately into another fandom's universe, as if they were native to that universe instead of their origin fandom — in other words: just like anyone else's Fandom AUs\n\nTrapped In Another World AUs\n\nIncludes various universe displacement AUs\nTypically verses where my muse finds themselves in another fandom's universe by one means or another, and their (likely impossible) mission to find a way back home while trying to survive in an unfamiliar world.\n\nOther Verses &amp; AUs\n\nMostly future proofing\nOccasional verses/AUs that just don't quite fit into the other categories.\n\nPrivate Verses &amp; AUs\n\nIncludes private Dynamic/Ship Verses &amp; AUs — not limited to romantic shipping\nMost commonly reserved for Mains, Best Friends Call Members, &amp; shipping partners\nOften plotted verses/AUs &amp; dynamics/ships, so if we've done a lot of plotting, or have developed dynamics/ships, I may switch the interactions to private verses so that I can more easily keep separate notes for the progression of the interactions and any verse/interactions specific divergences and/or plotting that we've established.\n\nThat don't fall into the realm of &quot;being a dick&quot; — any and all anon hate is screen capped and mocked privately with my friends, while the messages themselves are blocked and/or reported. ↩︎\n\nThis is made even worse when there is a lack of proper sentence case and punctuation, though I can usually tolerate it so long as paragraph breaks are used properly. ↩︎",
