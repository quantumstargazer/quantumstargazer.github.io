		"content": "Quantum Stargazer Wiki\n\n[!error] Under Emergency Construction\nSite is under emergency construction after the old wiki decided to start suffering from fatal errors on the host's end, so things are going to be a bit chaotic while I try to salvage the data from the old site to add to this one. Please be patient, as I am chronically ill and unable to always dedicate a lot of time and energy to this effort.\n\n[!WARNING] Testing In Progress\nGreat work. Because this message is prerecorded, any observations related to your performance are speculation on our part. Please disregard any undeserved compliments.\n\nQuantum Stargazer\nQuantum Stargazer is an Independent, Selective, 21+ &amp; Mutuals Only Multifandom Multimuse blog featuring canon, canon-based, and original characters from Baldur's Gate, Dragon Age, Mass Effect, &amp; more.\nRP Info\n\nMulti-Ship - Ships are not Highlanders — there can be more than one. And there will be. There will be.\nMulti-Verse - All <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Open Muses</a> have Canon-Based Verses, Fandom Specific AUs, Trapped In Another World AUs, &amp;/or Other Verses &amp; AUs.\nExtremely Crossover Friendly - If a verse &amp;/or doesn't exist, so long as I'm even remotely familiar with and interested in the fandom, chances are good that I'll add a verse to make it happen.\nLoose Plotting Only - Not a heavy or strict planner; if you are, then I'm probably not who you want to try to plot with.\nIn Character Posts Immediately - IC posts are never queued — only prompts, memes, aesthetics, etc. are queued.\n\n[!ziggy]- Wordy AF - Unapologetically Neurodivergent\nAuDHD means infodumping is likely to occur, and this means my posts, as well as the notes here, are likely to get wordy. I tend to try to be mindful of individual paragraph lengths, but there will often be a lot of paragraphs and/or bullet points.\nIf, for any reason, you are troubled by being expected to actually read things in a writing hobby that should, in theory, require at least 50% reading, considering it's collaborative nature, then I'm probably not the roleplay partner for you.\n\nInterest Forms\n\n[!info]- Interest Assumed For All Open Muses\nUnless you fill out the (Dis)Interest Tracker to tell me otherwise, if we're mutuals, it's assumed you're interested in interacting with any and all of my Open Muses in any of their canon-based verses and/or their fandom matched verses &amp; AUs.\n\n(Dis)Interest Tracker\nRP Preferences Tracker\nBest Friends Call[1]\n\nInteractions Calls\n\n[!info]- Request Interaction At Any Time\nThese forms are here to let you request interaction at any time, whether I'm actively on the dash or not (I lurk way more than it appears, since I don't really post from mobile, but I do read and draft things while afk from my desktop).\n\nStarter Call - for requesting that I write a starter for your muse(s)\nInbox Call - for requesting that I send prompts/memes to your inbox\n\nRules &amp; Guidelines\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">The Actual Rules</a> - must be read before following\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">RP Guidelines</a> - may not apply to everyone\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Frequently Asked Questions</a>\n\nMuse Rosters\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Open Muses</a> - priority muses — available to everyone\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">By Request Only</a> - available only on request\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Friends Only</a> - by invitation only\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Irregulars</a> - available only for Mains &amp; Best Friends Call Members\n\nAbout the Mun\n\nname/alias: Ziggy\npronouns: they/them\nage: 40+\n\n[!example]+ Fandoms\n\nBaldur's Gate[2] - secondary — moderate activity\nDragon Age - primary — high activity\nMass Effect - tertiary — low activity\n\n[!todo]- Other Fandoms\nThis is not an extensive list of fandoms I'm interested in &amp;/or familiar with enough to roleplay with. Please note: I don't keep up well with modern media, so don't expect me to be familiar with new things as soon as they come out.\n\nAddams Family\nDC (focus: Batman: The Animated Series)\nDetroit: Become Human\nDoctor Who (Expanded Universe)\nDungeons &amp; Dragons (tabletop rpg)\nElder Scrolls\nFallout\nForgotten Realms (D&amp;D setting)\nGhostbusters (focus: The Real Ghostbusters)[3]\nMarvel (focus: Iron Man/Tony Stark)[4]\nOur Flag Means Death\nStar Trek\nStardew Valley\nSupernatural\n\nFootnotes\n\nEssentially a permanent starter call with benefits — this is the only permanent starter call you will find on my blog. It's mostly a major reliever of social anxiety for me, for having explicit permission to interact. ↩︎\n\nIncorporates Forgotten Realms and D&amp;D/AD&amp;D lore for individual characters as needed, mostly through BG3 mods, but occasionally just additional lore needed to further flesh out the characters. ↩︎\n\nWhen I am writing Peter Venkman, he is not the movie-verse Venkman, but rather the further developed characterization from The Real Ghostbusters (ie the sharp minded businessman who has a soft spot for kids and little old ladies who remind him of his mom) and it is extremely important that this is respected — failure to do so will likely result in the interactions being dropped. ↩︎\n\nMostly the Marvel Cinematic Universe, prior to Avengers: Infinity War. In terms of my portrayal of Tony Stark, his MCU canon stops at Captain America: Civil War, where it then goes fully AU with dimensional travel and franchise swap, as he will be written as part of the DC universe, primarily focused on that of Batman: The Animated Series (as well as most of the animated movies), in addition to some fanmade content to be detailed in Tony's info once I'm ready to actually start writing him again. ↩︎",
