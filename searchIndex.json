		"content": "Open Muses Roster\n\n[!FAQ]- What Are Open Muses?\nOpen Muses are my primary muses, though that does not mean that they share the same activity level, as I base that off of fandom more than individual muse, as it tends to vary drastically, plus all of my muses have AUs for all of my primary fandoms. So while a muse's fandom might be tertiary in terms of activity, their verses/AUs for the primary fandom would likely have higher activity.\nThese are the muses that, unless you tell me you're not interested in them by filling out the (Dis)Interest Tracker form, then they are who I am more likely to throw your way at random, from any of their canon-based verses and/or fandom matched AUs.\n\nBaldur's Gate\nTavares Umbrafae\nHalf-Fey Aevendrow — Wintertouched Long Night Scion — Misfortune Bringer\n\n[!muse]- Archfey Warlock of the Prince of Frost\nTavares is a warlock in service of the Prince of Frost, tasked with bringing misfortune to Faerûn in exchange for being allowed to return to the material plane after &quot;seven years and a day&quot; that proved to have lasted decades longer than were claimed.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/z-baldur-s-gate/tavares-umbrafae/summary-tavares-umbrafae/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nWishlists\n\nFaeynore Moonstar\nMoon Elf — Private Investigator &amp; Spirit Medium — College of Glamour Bard\n\n[!muse]- Baldur's Gate PI for Over 200 Years\nFaeynore Moonstar is a private investigator out of Baldur's Gate, where she has often aided defendants in proving their innocence before the magistrates - including Magistrate Astarion Ancunín before his death some two centuries prior.\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/z-baldur-s-gate/faeynore-moonstar/summary-faeynore-moonstar/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nWishlists\n\nDirge\nGold Dwarf — College of Spirits Bard — Way of the Long Death Monk\n\n[!caution]- The Dark Urge\nUnable to recall their life from before the nautiloid, they only know their name is The Dark Urge, that they are a bardic monk, and that everyone would look so much better as a pretty corpse...\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/z-baldur-s-gate/dirge/summary-dirge/\">Dossiers &amp; Verses</a>\nConnections\nHeadcanons\nWishlists\n\nDragon Age\nAshina de Riva née Tabris\nCity Elf — Grey Wardens (defected) Antivan Crows — Master Assassin\n\n[!muse]- Hero of Ferelden turned Antivan Crow\nAshina was conscripted against her will into the Grey Wardens at the start of the Fifth Blight in 9:30 Dragon, going by the name of &quot;Tathas Arainai&quot;.

(9:45 - 9:54 Dragon)\n\nAshina de Riva is a Master Assassin of House de Riva of the Antivan Crows, likely serving as the Fifth Talon's Second, and is the Warden-Commander of Antiva. She specialises in contacts for entire noble households, methodically wiping out an entire family line and their house in a single evening.\nWhile it is known among the Crows that she is also a Grey Warden, few outside of a handful of Talons and other high ranking Crows know that she is, in fact, the notorious Hero of Ferelden, widely known as &quot;Warden Tathas&quot;, who joined the Antivan Crows in 9:33 Dragon to escape from Weisshaupt and the First Warden's orders that she be brought in for questioning regarding her surviving killing an archdemon.\n\n[!info]- Verse Navigation\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses/dragon-age/ashina-tabris/dossiers-and-verses/0-1-d-dragon-age-ashina-tabris/\">Dossier</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Headcanons</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Verse</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Wishlists</a>\n\nCanon Divergent AUs\n\n[!summary]+ Rook\n\nDefaults to Veilguard timeline. (9:50 - 9:54 Dragon)\n\nOne thing Ashina can never turn her back on is slavery, especially after the incident in the Denerim Alienage during the Fifth Blight, so there was simply no way she was going to ignore the Antaam slavers, especially when she spotted one of her own friends in their cages — not even to report in to her Talon for instruction.\nHer actions disrupt the Talons' plans — plans she hadn't been at all aware of — and as a result, she is sent on an extended contract to hunt the Dread Wolf when Varric Tethras shows up requesting her help in stopping Solas from destroying the world.\n\n[!info]- Verse Navigation\n\nDossier\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Headcanons</a>\nVerse\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Wishlists</a>\n\n[!summary]+ Inquisitor\n\nStarts in Inquisition timeline. (9:40 - 9:44 Dragon)\n\nAshina hadn't wanted anything to do with the Divine's Conclave, nor the Mage-Templar conflict, but she has no choice when the First Talon orders her to go spy on the meetings. When she finds signs of a Grey Warden presence at the Conclave, she knows something isn't right, and heads to where she suspects the records might be kept to check the list of expected attendees, only to stumble across the Warden mages in the middle of a blood magic ritual, and the Divine their intended sacrifice.\nWhen Ashina wakes up in the dungeon under Haven's chantry with now real memory of what happened at the temple, and a magical hole in her hand, she dreads having to send word back to the Talons to provide her report and try to explain how a Master Assassin is being accused of murdering the Divine, and worse still, once the Breach is calmed, is being called the Herald of Andraste.\n\n[!info]- Verse Navigation\n\nDossier\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Headcanons</a>\nVerse\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Wishlists</a>\n\n[!summary]+ Inquisitor Crow\n\nStarts in Inquisition timeline.

While she is being hailed as a murderer one minute — &quot;Assassin, thank you, — and the Herald of Andraste the next, she must find a way to send report to her Talon and hope things don't somehow get any worse...\n\n[!info]- Verse Navigation\n\nDossier\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Headcanons</a>\nVerse\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Wishlists</a>\n\n[!summary]+ Crows' Due\n\nStarts prior to 0rigins timeline.

Finding that she has had a child since fleeing Antiva, they capture Ashina, taking her back to Antiva and into the House to finish the training Adaia had begun. A child born of a Crow becomes a Crow, and Ashina is no exception.\n\n[!info]- Verse Navigation\n\nDossier\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Headcanons</a>\nVerse\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Wishlists</a>\n\n[!summary]+ Crows' Design\n\nStarts prior to 0rigins timeline.

The city guard arrive shortly after the elves do, so Ashina claims sole responsibility for the slaughter at the practice and is immediately arrested and thrown into the palace dungeons for the Arl to decide her fate once he returns from Ostagar.\nAshina has no intention of staying in the dungeons, waiting to be executed, so she looks for any way she can to escape her cell.

(9:55 - 9:69 Dragon)\n\nDespite her decades-long search, Ashina eventually succumbs to the blight in her veins, overcome by the Calling she has tried to avoid for so long. Refusing to keep the Warden tradition of fighting in the Deep Roads until her death — or worse — she instead turns to the Crows for a final contract to end her life.\nBut the world isn't finished with her yet, when she finds herself waking in a pile of shattered lyrium, and she's faced with being changed in a new way — no longer blighted, but now she isn't quite sure what she is anymore...\n\n[!info]- Verse Navigation\n\nDossier\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Headcanons</a>\nVerse\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Wishlists</a>\n\n[!summary]- VerseTitle\nSummary goes here.\n\n[!info]- Verse Navigation\n\nDossier\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Headcanons</a>\nVerse\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Wishlists</a>\n\n[!summary]- VerseTitle\nSummary goes here.\n\n[!info]- Verse Navigation\n\nDossier\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Headcanons</a>\nVerse\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Wishlists</a>\n\nFandom Specific AUs\nBaldur's Gate AUs\n\n[!summary]- Scion of the Outer Planes\nSummary goes here.\n\n[!info]- Verse Navigation\n\nDossier\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Headcanons</a>\nVerse\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Wishlists</a>\n\n[!summary]- Astral Drifter\nSummary goes here.\n\n[!info]- Verse Navigation\n\nDossier\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Headcanons</a>\nVerse\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Wishlists</a>\n\nDragon Age AUs\n\n[!summary]- VerseTitle\nSummary goes here.\n\n[!info]- Verse Navigation\n\nDossier\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Headcanons</a>\nVerse\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Wishlists</a>\n\nMass Effect AUs\n\n[!summary]- Mercenary Assassin\nSummary goes here.\n\n[!info]- Verse Navigation\n\nDossier\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Headcanons</a>\nVerse\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Wishlists</a>\n\nOther Fandoms AUs\nDoctor Who AUs\n\n[!summary]- In Time &amp;

Let's not, and say we did.&quot;\nSummary\nAshina de Riva is a Master Assassin of House de Riva of the Antivan Crows, likely serving as the Fifth Talon's Second, and is the Warden-Commander of Antiva. She specialises in contacts for entire noble households, methodically wiping out an entire family line and their house in a single evening.\nWhile it is known among the Crows that she is also a Grey Warden, few outside of a handful of Talons and other high ranking Crows know that she is, in fact, the notorious Hero of Ferelden, widely known as &quot;Warden Tathas&quot;, who joined the Antivan Crows in 9:33 Dragon to escape from Weisshaupt and the First Warden's orders that she be brought in for questioning regarding her surviving killing an archdemon.\nBasic Info\nBiographical Data\n\nname: Ashina de Riva\n\nAshina Tabris\n\nnickname: Ash\n\nSnapdragon (Varric Only)\n\nalias: The Grey Raven (Antivan Crows)\n\nThe Dark Wolf of Denerim\nWarden Tathas Adaia Arainai (formerly)\n\ngender: Female\npronouns: She/Her/Herself\napparent age: 45 +/- years (9:51 Dragon)\n\n44 +/- years (9:50 Dragon)\n39 +/- years (9:45 Dragon)\n34 +/- years (9:40 Dragon)\n29 +/- years (9:35 Dragon)\n24 +/- years (9:30 Dragon)\n\ndate of birth: 9:06 Dragon\n\n30th of Harvestmere (10th Month)\n\nPersonal Identity\n\nsexual orientation: Biromantic Bisexual\n\npolyamory: open to plotting\n\nMBTI: ISTJ-T\nEnneagram:\n\nPhysical Description\n\nspecies: Elf\nrace: City Elf\nethnicity: Antivan\nadditional ethnicities/cultures: Ferelden\nheight: 157 cm\n\n5 ft 1.81 in\n\nbody shape:\nhair: Black/Dark Brown\n\nDark Red Undertones/Highlights\nCurly\nShoulder Length\n\neyes: Amber Brown\ncomplexion: Brown Skin\n\nWarm Orange-Red Undertones\nBattle-Scarred\nTattooed\n\nDemographics\n\nplanet of origin: Thedas (planet name unknown)\nplace of birth: Denerim Alienage - Ferelden\nhomeworld: Thedas (planet name unknown)\nnationality: Antivan\n\nFerelden (formerly)\n\nhome town: Salle - Antiva\n\nDenerim - Ferelden (formerly)\n\nCommunication\n\nknown languages: Common Trade Tongue\n\nAntivan\nQunlat\nElvhen [1]\n\nSocial Standing &amp; Affiliations\n\naffiliated organizations: Antivan Crows\n\nHouse de Riva\n\nextended affiliations: Grey Wardens (defected)\nemployer(s)/patron(s): Antivan Crows\n\nFifth Talon of House de Riva\nViago de Riva - Fifth Talon\n\noccupation(s): Master Assassin\n\nWarden-Commander of Antiva\nWarden-Commander of Ferelden (formerly)\nDe Facto Arlessa of Amaranthine (formerly)\n\ntitle(s): Fifth Talon's Second\n\nWarden-Commander of Antiva\nDark Wolf of Denerim\nWarden-Commander of Ferelden (formerly)\nDe Facto Arlessa of Amaranthine (formerly)\nChampion of Redcliffe (formerly)\n\nSpiritual Beliefs\n\nbeliefs: atheist\npatron deity: n/a\npantheon: n/a\n\nRelationship Status\n\nrelationship status: single (rp conditional)\nshipping bias: Zevran Arainai (default if not romanced)\n\nSten\nMorrigan\nAnders\nSigrun\nViago de Riva\nAndarateia Cantori\nLucanis Dellamorte\n\nOrigin Attributes\n\nclass (primary): Master Assassin (Rogue)\nclass (secondary): Duelist (Rogue)\nclass (tertiary): Shadow (Rogue)\nclass (additional support): Bard (Rogue)\nfighting style: Dual Wield Blades\n\nArchery\nPoisons\n\nCurrent Status\n\ncurrent moral alignment: Chaotic Neutral\ncurrent role(s): Fifth Talon's Second\n\nMaster Assassin of House de Riva\nWarden-Commander of Antiva\n\ncurrent location(s): Treviso - Antiva\n\nSalle - Antiva\n\ncurrent residence(s): Cantori Diamond - Treviso - Antiva\n\nCasa de Riva - Treviso - Antiva\nCasa de Riva - Salle - Antiva\n\ncurrent vehicle(s): n/a\ncurrent situation status:\ncurrent conditions: Power of Blood (Rogue)\n\nBlighted (Warden Joining)\n\nBackground\nBirth &amp; Early Childhood\nAshina Tabris was born on the 30th of Harvestmere, 9:06 Dragon, to Cyrion Tabris and Adaia Tabris née Arainai, in the Alienage in Denerim, Ferelden.\nChildhood &amp; Adolescence\nAt the age of 17, Ashina witnessed the death of her mother at the hands of a group of humans while they were returning to the Alienage from the market. She had hid in the shadows, just as her mother had taught her, while Adaia was murdered, terrified of what they might do to her, should they find her.\nAdulthood\nFor years since Adaia's death, Ashina has been allowed the time to grieve her mother's loss without the added pressure from her father to marry so she might finally be recognized as an adult by Alienage standards.\nBy 9:30 Dragon, the hahren has finally convinced Cyrion that she's been allowed to delay long enough, and a marriage is arranged for her to Nelaros of Highever, a skilled blacksmith that Cyrion hopes will be a good match for his stubborn daughter.\nFifth Blight (9:30 - 9:31 Dragon)\nTBA\nAmaranthine Crisis (9:31 Dragon)\nTBA\nWitch Hunt (9:33 Dragon)\nTBA\nTalon Negotiations (9:33 Dragon)\nTBA\nDe Riva Fledgling (9:33 - 9:35 Dragon)\nTBA\nHouse de Riva Crow (9:35 Dragon)\nTBA\nCrow Mastery (9:36 - 9:37 Dragon)\nTBA\nA Talon's Second (9:42 Dragon)\nTBA\nTalon Troubles (9:45 Dragon)\nTBA\nAntaam Invasion (9:50 Dragon)\nTBA\nFuture Outlook\nSixth &amp; Final Blight (9:51 Dragon)\nTBA\n\nQuotes &amp; Catchphrases\n\n&quot;I killed them like dogs, Shianni. Not just them. All the humans who hurt you.&quot; — said to her cousin, Shianni, after freeing her and the other women stolen from the Alienage - 9:30 Dragon.\n&quot;Believe in whatever you like; absent creators or whimsical gods. Follow prophets or ashkaati, or omens in the earth and sky. You will find wisdom only if you seek it.&quot; — quoting Sten's wisdom from their time traveling together during the Fifth Blight.\n\nTrivia\n\nAshina's first kills were the ones she made freeing herself after being kidnapped, and she killed each and every guard and human noble that she came across, leaving a river of blood trailing behind her as she fought to try to reach Shianni in time.\n\nQuick Guide To Interacting\nThings You Should Know\n\nAshina Tabris Is Dead - Ashina completely stops going by her actual name of &quot;Ashina Tabris&quot; when she is no longer living within the Denerim Alienage — whether this is by being conscripted by the Grey Wardens, taken by the Antivan Crows, or whatever other fate she faces. Very few people who meet her after this ever learn her true family name, and many may never even learn her given name, if she introduces herself as &quot;Tathas Arainai&quot; instead.\nAdaia Was An Antivan Crow - Adaia was a Crow of House Arainai, who ran away from the Crows in 9:06 Dragon. She would eventually find herself in Denerim, where she married Cyrion and gave birth to Ashina on the 30th of Harvestmere.\n\n[!info]- Questions of Paternity\nThere were plenty of questions around the Alienage as to whether Cyrion was truly Ashina's father, given the timing, and how little she favors him, while being very clearly Antivan.\n\n[!spoiler]-\nWhile still in Antiva, Adaia learned she was pregnant, and in House Arainai, a child born of a Crow becomes a Crow, and so Adaia flees to Ferelden in hopes of giving her child a chance and a choice of their own future. She was vocally against the Alienage tradition of only being recognized as an adult by marrying, fought to keep the hahren from trying to force Ashina to marry until she wanted to, and preferably for love.\nEven though she might not be his by blood, Ashina is Cyrion's daughter. She doesn't know who her biological father is, but it is most likely another elven Crow in House Arainai.\n\nThings Your Muse Could Know\n\nTathas Arainai, Hero of Ferelden - Most people believe that the Hero of Ferelden's name is Tathas Arainai. As time progresses, fewer remember she is an elf, said to be from Denerim, despite her Antivan name and appearance. Given the mixed feelings many people have regarding the hero's actions during the Fifth Blight, and a few months later in Amaranthine, she had became rather more notorious, at least among nobles, before she was said to have been killed by Antivan Crows in 9:33 Dragon.\nWanted By Weisshaupt (Wardens &amp; Crows, mostly) - &quot;Warden Tathas&quot; is wanted by Weisshaupt for &quot;questioning&quot; regarding her survival after killing the archdemon, successfully ending the Fifth Blight, and then her interactions with the Architect approximately six months later, who she permits to live so long as he leaves. The First Warden never officially rescinded the orders to bring her in, alive, after word of the Crows finishing their contracts against her began to spread.\n\nThings Your Muse Should Not Know\n\nSecrets Untold - Unless they traveled with her during the Fifth Blight, or they knew her from Amaranthine, they are unlikely to know that Ashina even is the Hero of Ferelden, as she leaves that life — and the name &quot;Tathas Arainai&quot; — behind when she join House de Riva in 9:33 Dragon. From that point forward, she is only known as Ashina de Riva.\n\nExpanded Details\n\n[!TODO] To Be Added Later\n\nTV Tropes\n\nApplicable Mods\n\nFootnotes\n\nLearned from the trapped spirit in the Brecillian Forest during the Fifth Blight. ↩︎",

Please be patient, as I am chronically ill and unable to always dedicate a lot of time and energy to this effort.\n\n[!WARNING] Testing In Progress\nGreat work. Because this message is prerecorded, any observations related to your performance are speculation on our part. Please disregard any undeserved compliments.\n\nQuantum Stargazer\nQuantum Stargazer is an Independent, Selective, 21+ &amp; Mutuals Only Multifandom Multimuse blog featuring canon, canon-based, and original characters from Baldur's Gate, Dragon Age, Mass Effect, &amp; more.\nRP Info\n\nMulti-Ship - Ships are not Highlanders — there can be more than one. And there will be. There will be.\nMulti-Verse - All <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses-roster/\">Open Muses</a> have Canon-Based Verses, Fandom Specific AUs, Trapped In Another World AUs, &amp;/or Other Verses &amp; AUs.\nExtremely Crossover Friendly - If a verse &amp;/or doesn't exist, so long as I'm even remotely familiar with and interested in the fandom, chances are good that I'll add a verse to make it happen.\nLoose Plotting Only - Not a heavy or strict planner; if you are, then I'm probably not who you want to try to plot with.\nIn Character Posts Immediately - IC posts are never queued — only prompts, memes, aesthetics, etc. are queued.\n\n[!ziggy]- Wordy AF - Unapologetically Neurodivergent\nAuDHD means infodumping is likely to occur, and this means my posts, as well as the notes here, are likely to get wordy. I tend to try to be mindful of individual paragraph lengths, but there will often be a lot of paragraphs and/or bullet points.\nIf, for any reason, you are troubled by being expected to actually read things in a writing hobby that should, in theory, require at least 50% reading, considering it's collaborative nature, then I'm probably not the roleplay partner for you.\n\nInterest Forms\n\n[!info]- Interest Assumed For All Open Muses\nUnless you fill out the (Dis)Interest Tracker to tell me otherwise, if we're mutuals, it's assumed you're interested in interacting with any and all of my Open Muses in any of their canon-based verses and/or their fandom matched verses &amp; AUs.\n\n(Dis)Interest Tracker\nRP Preferences Tracker\nBest Friends Call[1]\n\nInteractions Calls\n\n[!info]- Request Interaction At Any Time\nThese forms are here to let you request interaction at any time, whether I'm actively on the dash or not (I lurk way more than it appears, since I don't really post from mobile, but I do read and draft things while afk from my desktop).\n\nStarter Call - for requesting that I write a starter for your muse(s)\nInbox Call - for requesting that I send prompts/memes to your inbox\n\nRules &amp; Guidelines\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/actual-rules/\">The Actual Rules</a> - must be read before following\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/guidelines/\">RP Guidelines</a> - may not apply to everyone\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/rp-faq/\">Frequently Asked Questions</a>\n\nMuse Rosters\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/open-muses-roster/\">Open Muses</a> - priority muses — available to everyone\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/by-request-only-roster/\">By Request Only</a> - available only on request\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/friends-only-roster/\">Friends Only</a> - by invitation only\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/muse-info/irregulars-roster/\">Irregulars</a> - available only for Mains &amp; Best Friends Call Members\n\nAbout the Mun\n\nname/alias: Ziggy\npronouns: they/them\nage: 40+\n\n[!example]+ Fandoms\n\nBaldur's Gate[2] - secondary — moderate activity\nDragon Age - primary — high activity\nMass Effect - tertiary — low activity\n\n[!todo]- Other Fandoms\nThis is not an extensive list of fandoms I'm interested in &amp;/or familiar with enough to roleplay with. Please note: I don't keep up well with modern media, so don't expect me to be familiar with new things as soon as they come out.\n\nAddams Family\nDC (focus: Batman: The Animated Series)\nDetroit: Become Human\nDoctor Who (Expanded Universe)\nDungeons &amp; Dragons (tabletop rpg)\nElder Scrolls\nFallout\nForgotten Realms (D&amp;D setting)\nGhostbusters (focus: The Real Ghostbusters)[3]\nMarvel (focus: Iron Man/Tony Stark)[4]\nOur Flag Means Death\nStar Trek\nStardew Valley\nSupernatural\n\nFootnotes\n\nEssentially a permanent starter call with benefits — this is the only permanent starter call you will find on my blog. It's mostly a major reliever of social anxiety for me, for having explicit permission to interact. ↩︎\n\nIncorporates Forgotten Realms and D&amp;D/AD&amp;D lore for individual characters as needed, mostly through BG3 mods, but occasionally just additional lore needed to further flesh out the characters. ↩︎\n\nWhen I am writing Peter Venkman, he is not the movie-verse Venkman, but rather the further developed characterization from The Real Ghostbusters (ie the sharp minded businessman who has a soft spot for kids and little old ladies who remind him of his mom) and it is extremely important that this is respected — failure to do so will likely result in the interactions being dropped. ↩︎\n\nMostly the Marvel Cinematic Universe, prior to Avengers: Infinity War. In terms of my portrayal of Tony Stark, his MCU canon stops at Captain America: Civil War, where it then goes fully AU with dimensional travel and franchise swap, as he will be written as part of the DC universe, primarily focused on that of Batman: The Animated Series (as well as most of the animated movies), in addition to some fanmade content to be detailed in Tony's info once I'm ready to actually start writing him again. ↩︎",

		"url":"/rules-and-guidelines/actual-rules/",
		"content": "The Actual Rules\n\n[!attention]- Read Rules Before Following\nI actively block people who obviously did not read my rules before following me first — typically for their being under the age of 21, and/or their blog containing banned content such as fandoms, faceclaims, &amp;/or tropes &amp; themes.\n\nDon't Be A Dick\nThis should got without saying, and yet...\n21+ &amp; Mutuals Only\n\n[!caution]- Viewer Discretion Is Advised\nMost of my fandoms are literally rated M for Mature Audiences, and as such my blogs and wiki are rated the same. See <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/rp-faq/mature-audiences-only-faq/\">Mature Audiences Only - FAQ</a> for additional information, including a list of content that you may need to be aware of regarding squicks and triggers.\n\n[!rule]- Must Be 18+ To Follow\nI hard block any minors — as well as any blogs who do not list an age at all — who follow me. I do not roleplay with anyone under the age of 21, however, so if you are 18 to 20, you are welcome to follow, but I will not be writing with you until you are at least 21.\n\nIf you don't have an age range that actively states you are at least 21+ listed on your blog and/or in your rules, I will not follow you, nor will I write roleplay with you. I am in my early 40s, and just simply do not wish to write with anyone younger than US drinking age at this point.\nCurate Your Own Dash\n\n[!fail]- Regarding Others' &quot;Dead Dove: Do Not Eat&quot; Warnings\nI do not follow anyone whose only warnings for their blog consists of &quot;Dead Dove&quot; without covering what topics, themes, tropes, etc. are likely to be found on the blog. And given that I typically block blogs with explicit roleplayed scenes involving rape, sexual assault, Alpha/Beta/Omega dynamics, etc., if &quot;Dead Dove: Do Not Eat&quot; is the only warning you provide, then I'm going to assume that's what you write, and will proceed to curate my own dash accordingly.\nWithout any explanation, it's as effective as saying &quot;Warning: Consider Yourself Warned&quot; while inviting people to potentially walk into a nuclear reactor.\n\nDon't Like? Don't Follow.\nIf you don't like me, my muses, my verses, my blog, etc., then just don't follow me — in fact, if you feel that strongly about any of these things, you should probably hard block me and keep me blocked [1] instead, so as to keep my content off your dash.\nHard Block Only - No Soft Block\nIf you feel the need to block me at all for any reason, hard block me, even if you typically only soft block. I am unable to reliably remember if someone has simply soft blocked me instead, and may refollow if I find your blog again in the future, being completely unable to remember that I had followed you in the past. [1:1]\nBanned &amp; Restricted Content\nTropes &amp; Themes\n\n[!danger]+ Banned Tropes &amp; Themes — No Follow &amp;/or Interaction\n\nsexual content with any muse &amp;/or faceclaim under the age of 18\nscenes involving explicit acts of rape/noncon, sexual assault, sexual violence, etc.\nscenes involving sexual abuse, up to and including incest, pedophilia, etc.\nanything involving Alpha/Beta/Omega (Omegaverse) dynamics &amp;/or settings\n\n[!warning]+ Restricted Tropes &amp; Themes\n\nmagic anons of any kind\nscenes involving pregnancy complications, miscarriage, infant death, etc.\nscenes involving active labor and/or childbirth [2]\n\nFandoms\n\n[!danger]+ Banned Fandoms — No Follow &amp;/or Interaction\n\nHarry Potter &amp; Related Fandoms (JK Rowling) [3]\nThe Boys (2019)\n\nFaceclaims\n\n[!danger]+ Faceclaims — No Follow &amp;/or Interaction\n\nAlexandra Daddario\nAnna Speckhart\nAnya Taylor-Joy\nKayla Scodelario\nEline Powell\nJessica Chastain\nModels\n\n[!warning]+ Restricted Faceclaims\n\nMusicians [4]\nYoutubers [4:1]\n\nAdditional Guidelines May Apply\nBecause the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/guidelines/\">Guidelines</a> are not entirely universal, depending on which fandoms someone is or isn't interested in, how they may wish to interact (for example: whether or not they have any interest in shipping), etc., these are listed separate from the actual rules.\nThat said, when the guidelines do apply to you, they are considered rules for you, though I may be more willing to make exceptions on an individual basis, but this should not be considered the standard, nor should it be expected of me. It is extremely rare that I make exceptions for anyone, but it has been known to happen occasionally.\n\nFootnotes\n\nI have severe memory issues due to various comorbid medical conditions, including a traumatic brain injury, so I sincerely cannot be relied on to remember if you merely unfollowed &amp;/or soft blocked me. It is for the best that I simply remain blocked, and that if you move to a new blog in the future, especially if you change your username, that you continue to block me from the new blog(s) as well. ↩︎ ↩︎\n\nIf pregnancy becomes a part of any interaction, the active labor and childbirth will be time skipped to when the baby has arrived and has been cleaned up — no exceptions. ↩︎\n\nI don't care how anti-JK Rowling you are — I will not follow or interact with you if you have any Harry Potter muses or verses/AUs on your blog. If we are mutuals, and you add such muses and/or verses/AUs in the future, I will break mutual status by hard blocking you. There will be no exceptions to this rule. ↩︎\n\nIf they have genuine face acting roles, such as would be the case with someone like David Bowie in Labyrinth (1986), then they're fine. Cameos do not count, especially in the case of Youtubers. ↩︎ ↩︎",

		"content": "Guidelines\n\n[!attention]- Read Rules Before Following\nIf you haven't done so already, you should read <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/rules-and-guidelines/actual-rules/\">The Actual Rules</a> before following. These guidelines are only an expansion of that and may not apply to everyone, depending on fandoms, interaction preferences, interest in shipping, etc., unlike the rules themselves.\n\nInteractions\nInbox\nYou can send asks/prompts/memes/etc. to the inbox on either quantumstargazer and/or gazingintoquantumstars[1].\nReverse Prompts/Memes\nYou are always welcome to reverse any meme and/or prompts (including sentence starters), simply by stating that you want it reversed, whether the original meme/prompt mentions the option in it or not.\nWe're here to have fun, so if something fits better if it's my muse doing or saying the thing instead of yours (or vise versa, depending on the meme/prompt), then I'm game for flipping the script regardless of what the original meme/prompt poster intended.\nAdding Context To Memes/Prompts\nYou are always welcome to add context and/or expand on any meme and/or prompt (including sentence starters). In fact, it helps a great deal whenever someone does if they have something in particular in mind.\n\n[!guideline] Answered As Text Posts\nAs I always turn asks into text posts rather than publishing the original ask, if you mention you want any part of the ask kept private (do so in the ask itself so that it doesn't get lost in chats), I will simply not copy that part of the message into the text post when I actually publish it.\n\nContinue As Threads\nYou are always welcome to continue answered in character prompts/memes into threads. I answer most asks as new text posts, and will tag these as &quot;Closed Starter&quot;, along with a thread tracking tag[2], if I anticipate it to potentially continued as a thread.\nPrompts Never Expire\nThere is no expiration date on most memes/prompts/etc. (I might side-eye you if you send a winter holiday meme in the middle of summer, though), and they can be found on both quantumstargazer and gazingintoquantumstars, and can be sent to either inbox.\nThe latter is a sideblog where I reblog memes/prompts/etc to in order to reblog a smaller selection to my roleplay blog. If you can't find anything in my rp blog's prompts tag that strikes your fancy, try the sideblog instead, as there is a wider selection there, and is broken down even further by types of prompts/memes than simply IC or OOC like my roleplay blog's tags.\nInclude Full Prompt When Sending\nI am not always able to fill memes and/or prompts right away, so please be sure to include the full prompt when sending anything that isn't simply a sentence starter (and/or include a link to the meme itself so I can find it later).\n\n[!guideline] Repeated Emojis &amp; Mistaken Prompts For Sentence Starters\nThis is especially true for emoji memes[3], as well as anything along the lines of &quot;Send 'This is an example' for a starter about whatever the prompt is for&quot; style memes, which are often easily confused for sentence starters if the full prompt isn't included.\n\nSend Any Time\nYou do not have to wait for me to be active on the dash to send things! My inbox is always open, unless I have literally turned it off.\nI end up spending a lot of time on mobile, and since I rely heavily on userscripts and stylesheets for tumblr rp, in addition to X-Kit Rewritten, you won't see me making many posts, even OOC ones, from mobile. But I can work on things from mobile and then transcribe them later on the desktop for posting, so please do send me as many things as you want.\nStarters\nRandom Starters\nI do, on occasion, write random, unprompted starters for people, but usually this is reserved for my Mains and the Best Friends Call Members. So if you'd like me to just send stuff at you randomly, please fill out the Best Friends Call form to give me permission to do so.\nRequesting Starters\nYou can request for me to write starters for your muses from mine at any time by filling out the Starter Call form linked in the pinned post and/or on the homepage of this site.\n\n[!guideline] Form Required To Request Starters\nThe form is very minimal, but is easier for me to keep track of what has and has not been filled than posts with &quot;like this post for a starter&quot;, especially since I prefer it when people actually specify which muses and/or verses they want starters from.\nThe form does offer a &quot;Ziggy's Choice&quot; option for those who aren't picky and/or are feeling indecisive, though I may be slower to fill such requests if I don't have any direction whatsoever to work from.\n\nShips &amp; Dynamics\nMulti-Shipping\nShips (as well as dynamics) are not Highlanders — there can be more than one. There is no cheating (unless specifically plotted and agreed upon ooc, and even then it is strictly with regards to NPCs and not other people's portrayals, as I am not interested in interacting in most group verses and/or AU scenarios involving multiple muns in a shared verse setting[4]).\nChemistry\nChemistry is paramount when it comes to shipping and many dynamics. This can be achieved through in character interactions and/or out of character plotting and approved headcanons, but it still needs to exist.\nFlirting ≠ Forced Shipping\nWhile I'm always willing to test the waters with letting the characters have some flirtatious banter, progressing into anything remotely serious between them needs to have chemistry, whether it is built in and/or out of character.\nYour muse can always flirt with mine, but that doesn't mean it will always be reciprocated (or that they even recognize they're being flirted with — some can be a bit oblivious on that front).\nDynamics\nPlatonic\nPlatonic dynamics are still chemistry based for progression — strangers, acquaintances, casual friends, coworkers, family, etc. are all baseline starting points for platonic dynamics, but the deeper the connection, the more important chemistry becomes.\nQueerplatonic\nQueerplatonic dynamics are welcome, and are dependent on chemistry in much the same way of romantic dynamics.\nShipping\nRomanic Ships\nRomantic ships are strictly chemistry based — if the muses don't have chemistry, then a romantic ship isn't likely to develop. At least not without more plotting, and may require a soft reset of their interactions to try again.\nSexual Ships\nSexual ships — which may be independent of a romantic ship, in cases of more casual sexual dynamics — are also reliant on chemistry for actual progression, though this may be less necessary for more casual sexual encounters than for other sexual dynamics.\nSmut\nNo Ship/Dynamic Required To Start — While I'm not here to write just smut, some of my muses are open to more casual sexual encounters than others, so it's not impossible to have smut be a part of the muses' dynamics without there being a need for anything beyond mutual agreement to test things out through in character interactions.\n\n[!guideline] Spicy Prompts Open To All Mutuals\nThis can be done simply my sending a prompt/meme from the ones tagged as &quot;Spicy&quot;, for both in and/or out of character responses.\n\nVerses &amp; AUs\nPrivate Verses &amp; AUs\nPrivate Verses &amp; AUs are largely reserved for Mains, Best Friends Call Members, and partners with whom I'm shipping with and/or our muses have strong dynamics together.\nGenerally speaking, if I'm likely to want and/or need to have room to where I can make notes to track progression of the pairing's dynamics together, then I'll probably tag it as a private verse and have dedicated note pages to keep track of such things on here.\nInteracting In Other Muns' Private Verses &amp; AUs\nIt is exceptionally rare that I am willing to let anyone interact within any private verses, largely due to the fact that even mutual mutuals can one day not be mutuals anymore, and so there is the matter of untangling the mess then when it comes to dissolving those connections.\nAs such, private verses are most likely available only for their intended partner that is actively mentioned in the verse's tag itself.\nFandom-Specific Rules\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Baldur's Gate - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Dragon Age - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Mass Effect - Guidelines</a>\n\n[!example]- Other Fandoms - Guidelines\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Doctor Who - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Elder Scrolls - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Fallout - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Stardew Valley - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Star Trek - Guidelines</a>\n\n[!example]- Tertiary Fandoms - Guidelines\n\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">DC - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Detroit Become Human - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Ghostbusters - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Good Omens - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Marvel - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Our Flag Means Death - Guidelines</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Supernatural - Guidelines</a>\n\nFootnotes\n\nSideblog for archiving any and all of the memes, prompts lists, etc. for personal roleplaying purposes. All memes on the blog are considered &quot;active&quot; and may be sent in no matter how long ago I reblogged it. ↩︎\n\nTagged as ; partnerurl / partnermuse &amp; mymuse / 000 with the appropriate number for which thread the interaction is. ↩︎\n\nMany of which don't even show up correctly on the desktop, plus emojis get reused between memes all the time, and with no expiration date on how long ago I reblogged something for someone to send it, those emojis are bound to have been used by multiple memes. ↩︎\n\nMy social anxiety disorder simply just can't handle it, especially if it's involving people that I'm not actively friends with myself. So the likeliness of me agreeing to be a part of a group verse in any way is slim to none, with none being the more likely outcome. ↩︎",

The RP Preference Tracker is intended to cover as least the basics of what I usually prefer to know that isn't always covered in other people's guidelines, and aren't always answered through some random memes post or a reblogged PSA.\nOptional But Recommended\nThis form is completely optional, but recommended, especially if you're wanting to run multiple threads with the same muse pairings, potentially develop ships &amp;/or deeper dynamics, have topics/tropes you specifically don't want to write, etc.\nBest Friends Call\n\n[!info]- Intended For Mutuals Who Have Already Started Interacting\nIf we haven't even said so much as &quot;hello&quot; to each other yet, chances are it's too soon to fill this form out. This is effectively a permanent starter call, and if we've yet to start writing &amp;/or plotting together, I'm not going to add you to the members list until we are.\n\nThis is the closest thing I have to a permanent starter call, and it comes with additional benefits beyond my just sending you starters at random.\nTerms of Use\nShould you choose to join this list, you are helping reduce anxiety to interact on a regular basis by providing me with authorisation for the following:\n\nThe right to send/tag you in starters whenever the whim takes me;\nThe right to send you a message via IM/Discord/Ask with plots/ideas for threads/AUs/general buffoonery;\nThe right to tag you in shit that I come across that makes me take pause and think ‘Yup. This is them. This is them to a T. This is our idiots.’;\nThe right to tag you in wishlist stuff;\nThe right to send you a shit tonne[1] of prompts/memes should you reblog same;\nThe above rights are reciprocal;\n\nYou can send/tag me in starters whenever the whim takes you, including whenever you post starter calls that I miss on the dash;\nYou can send me messages via Discord and/or tumblr ask with plots/ideas for threads/AUs/general buffoonery;\nYou can tag me in shit that you come across that makes you take pause and think ‘Yup. This is them. This is them to a T. This is our idiots.’;\nYou can tag me in wishlist stuff;\nYou can send a shit tonne[1:1] of prompts/memes at any time from anything I've reblogged — and even stuff I haven't[2];\nYou also gain automatic access to all of my muses (minus those that are by invitation only), though reply speeds for muses will often be slower than the primary muses as muse inspiration waxes and wanes;\nYou don't have to specify a muse and/or verse when sending prompts/memes and whatnot (though it is still preferred that you do whenever possible);\n\nTo provide you with general messages of love, favour, and/or affection from now into perpetuity.\n\nThe above call extends to all forms of ships, including but not restricted to: friendships, romantic ships, companionships, enemy combatant ships, apprenticeships, worships, and more.\n\nFootnotes\n\nAs defined by that moment when you think 'Get them to fucking stop, this is too much'. ↩︎ ↩︎\n\nMembers of the Best Friends Call have my permission to answer memes as if I had sent them even if I didn’t but you want that meme between our muses. Muns whom I already ship with - even with other muses that you write - absolutely can include shippy memes in that as well. Just message me before answering anything sexual the first time, since that’s where I’m more highly selective about who I will and won’t write those ships with, yeah? Some on the dash call these &quot;non-negotiable memes&quot;, but of course it's up to you as to whether to accept and/or continue anything sent or received this way. ↩︎",

		"content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\n[!faq] If You Have Questions, Just Ask!\nYou're always welcome to send any questions you might have[1] for me to my inbox on tumblr.\n\nBlocking\nFollowing &amp; Unfollowing\nPreferences\nPost Formatting\n\n[!warning]- Regarding Accessible Formatting\nI use a series of userscripts and stylesheets to make the tumblr dashboard accessible to me, and without them, I often risk triggering a migraine just by scrolling past certain posts (typically those with double and/or multiple spaced text). These codes will be made available in the near future for everyone else to have access to as well.\n\nText Formatting\nWhat I use for formatting versus what I actually see on my display is not always the same thing, thanks to the stylesheets and userscripts I use. Tumblr's default font sizes for both regular and small text are uncomfortable for me to read, so I have made adjustments to both via stylesheets.\n\nFormatting\nStyle Used By Ziggy\nAccessibility?\n\nSpacing\nSingle Spaced Only\nUserscript\n\nText Size\nTumblr Default + Small Text for inline footnotes.\nStylesheet\n\nFont Style\nTumblr Default\nStylesheet\n\nFont Color\nTumblr Default\nStylesheet\n\nOther Post Details\nIn terms of icons and graphics, I don't care what others use, unless you make a habit of using flashing gifs, at which point I may not be able to interact with you if it proves to be a problem with my migraines.\nIn terms of the actual text, please be sure to use proper paragraph breaks and sentence case, as the lack of such often makes it impossible for me to read, between the constant low level headaches that I have (not including the migraine spikes), and the ADHD making large single blocks of text often impossible to keep up with where I am in them.[2]\n\nDetail\nStyle Used By Ziggy\nAccessibility?\n\nIcons\nNone Used\nn/a\n\nGraphics\nBanners &amp; Dividers\nn/a\n\nParagraph Length\nTypically 4 to 6 lines, minus inline footnotes\nn/a\n\nCase (ie Capitalisation)\nProper Sentence Case\n(working on it)\n\nVerses &amp; AUs\nCanon-Based Verses &amp; AUs\n\nIncludes Canon Typical &amp; Canon Divergent AUs\nThese are the standard verses that take place within the muse's origin fandom universe, whether sticking closer to whatever the muse's personal canon (ie Canon Typical) is, or being an alternate variant of such (ie Canon Divergent AUs)\n\nFandom Specific AUs\n\nIncludes various crossover AUs\nThese verses are where my muse's backstory is rewritten to fit them appropriately into another fandom's universe, as if they were native to that universe instead of their origin fandom — in other words: just like anyone else's Fandom AUs\n\nTrapped In Another World AUs\n\nIncludes various universe displacement AUs\nTypically verses where my muse finds themselves in another fandom's universe by one means or another, and their (likely impossible) mission to find a way back home while trying to survive in an unfamiliar world.\n\nOther Verses &amp; AUs\n\nMostly future proofing\nOccasional verses/AUs that just don't quite fit into the other categories.\n\nPrivate Verses &amp; AUs\n\nIncludes private Dynamic/Ship Verses &amp; AUs — not limited to romantic shipping\nMost commonly reserved for Mains, Best Friends Call Members, &amp; shipping partners\nOften plotted verses/AUs &amp; dynamics/ships, so if we've done a lot of plotting, or have developed dynamics/ships, I may switch the interactions to private verses so that I can more easily keep separate notes for the progression of the interactions and any verse/interactions specific divergences and/or plotting that we've established.\n\nFootnotes\n\nThat don't fall into the realm of &quot;being a dick&quot; — any and all anon hate is screen capped and mocked privately with my friends, while the messages themselves are blocked and/or reported. ↩︎\n\nThis is made even worse when there is a lack of proper sentence case and punctuation, though I can usually tolerate it so long as paragraph breaks are used properly. ↩︎",

But there are people with whom I write it, and not every aspect of it is consistently tagged with content warnings. ↩︎\n\nThere are some dynamics in private verses where the consent may appear dubious from an outside perspective, but the plotting behind the scenes has ensured both muses are, in fact, fully consenting to any such sexual encounters, and/or they may be roleplaying themselves because they're kinky bastards that way. ↩︎",
