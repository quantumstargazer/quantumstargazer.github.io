## Post Formatting
> [!warning]- Regarding Accessible Formatting
> I use a series of userscripts and stylesheets to make the tumblr dashboard accessible to me, and without them, I often risk triggering a migraine just by scrolling past certain posts (typically those with double and/or multiple spaced text). These codes will be made available in the near future for everyone else to have access to as well.
### Text Formatting
*What I use for formatting versus what I actually see on my display is not always the same thing, thanks to the stylesheets and userscripts I use. Tumblr's default font sizes for both regular and small text are uncomfortable for me to read, so I have made adjustments to both via stylesheets.*

| Formatting | Style Used By Ziggy                               | Accessibility? |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | :------------: |
| Spacing    | Single Spaced Only                                |   Userscript   |
| Text Size  | Tumblr Default + Small Text for inline footnotes. |   Stylesheet   |
| Font Style | Tumblr Default                                    |   Stylesheet   |
| Font Color | Tumblr Default                                    |   Stylesheet   |
### Other Post Details
*In terms of icons and graphics, I don't care what others use, unless you make a habit of using flashing gifs, at which point I may not be able to interact with you if it proves to be a problem with my migraines.*

*In terms of the actual text, please be sure to use proper paragraph breaks and sentence case, as the lack of such often makes it impossible for me to read, between the constant low level headaches that I have (not including the migraine spikes), and the ADHD making large single blocks of text often impossible to keep up with where I am in them.*[^3]

| Detail                     | Style Used By Ziggy                            |  Accessibility?   |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | :---------------: |
| Icons                      | None Used                                      |        n/a        |
| Graphics                   | Banners & Dividers                             |        n/a        |
| Paragraph Length           | Typically 4 to 6 lines, minus inline footnotes |        n/a        |
| Case (*ie Capitalisation*) | Proper Sentence Case                           | (*working on it*) |

# Verses & AUs
> [!rule]+ Fandom Matched By Default
> **I will typically match fandom to fandom**, so whatever fandom your muse is being written in the setting of, I will use my corresponding verse and/or AU that matches that fandom. If I don't have an established verse already, I may create one for your muse's fandom, in either the Fandom Specific AUs and/or Trapped In Another World AUs variants.

> [!guideline]+ Mix & Match Fandoms On Request
> **I am open to playing with mix & match fandom selections**, so if you want to explore a specific fandom setting with our muses from any combination of their available verses and AUs, then all you have to do is ask. The answer will almost always be "*yes*", so long as I'm even remotely familiar with the fandom you want to set things in.

## Types of Available Verses & AUs
### Canon-Based Verses & AUs 
- *Includes **Canon Typical** & **Canon Divergent AUs***
- These are the standard verses that take place within the muse's origin fandom universe, whether sticking closer to whatever the muse's personal canon (ie *Canon Typical*) is, or being an alternate variant of such (ie *Canon Divergent AUs*)
### Fandom Specific AUs 
- *Includes various crossover AUs*
- These verses are where my muse's backstory typically is rewritten to fit them appropriately into another fandom's universe, as if they were *native* to that universe instead of their origin fandom — *in other words: **just like anyone else's Fandom AUs***
### Trapped In Another World AUs 
- *Includes various universe displacement AUs*
- Typically verses where my muse finds themselves in another fandom's universe by one means or another, and their (likely impossible) mission to find a way back home while trying to survive in an unfamiliar world.
### Other Verses & AUs
- *Mostly future proofing*
- Occasional verses/AUs that just don't quite fit into the other categories.
- May include any purely multifandom verses &/or AUs.
### Private Verses & AUs
- *Includes private Dynamic/Ship Verses & AUs — not limited to romantic shipping*
- *Most commonly reserved for Mains, Best Friends Call Members, & shipping partners*
- **Often plotted verses/AUs & dynamics/ships**, so if we've done a lot of plotting, or have developed dynamics/ships, I may switch the interactions to private verses so that I can more easily keep separate notes for the progression of the interactions and any verse/interactions specific divergences and/or plotting that we've established.

# Following & Unfollowing
## Following
**I only follow people I actually want to write with.** So if I'm following you, I *want* to write with you — and you're welcome to jump into my inbox or hit me up on discord as soon as we're mutuals.

## Unfollowing
### No Interactions
If my attempts at initiating interaction go ignored for an excessively extended period of time, I may choose to break mutual status and unfollow. I'm patient, but when 6+ months passes and I've been ignored that whole time after repeated attempted to start ic and/or ooc interactions, it is usually at that point that I will assume you're not likely to ever respond and I will stop trying, choosing to focus my attention and energy elsewhere.
### Archived Blogs
I will typically unfollow any archived blogs whenever I notice the announcement that it's being moved to a new blog. If we haven't been actively writing with each other, I typically *won't* follow the new blog first, and will leave it to you to decide whether or not you wish to continue being mutuals.
### Sudden Incompatibility
If your rules change and suddenly become incompatible with my own, or your entire blogs changes to the point that I'm no longer comfortable following you for whatever reason, I will typically unfollow and likely block in the process as well, where such incompatibility issues are concerned so as not to accidentally refollow again in the future.

# Blocking
**I make liberal use of the block button.** In most cases, it is nothing personal — I am simply using the feature to its fullest to curate my dash as I see fit.
## Hard Block - Never Soft Block
I have severe memory issues, so I do *not* soft block, even if that is *your* preference. My memory is not reliable enough to ensure I don't attempt to refollow anyone who isn't hard blocked, so I will *always* outright hard block anyone I do not wish to see on my dash at all. If you are bothered by people hard blocking you, then I may not be a suitable roleplay partner for you, in the event that blocking is ever needed in the future, because I will *not* be making exceptions to this for *anyone*.

# Random Vaguely Related Things
## Corrections Welcome
**If you notice broken links, typos, grammar mistakes, etc., *absolutely* let me know!** I run on a perpetual *negative spoons* in terms of energy available, so it can take me hours, days, or even months to notice something is off. I will *not* be upset with you for telling me that there is a technical issue that is in need of being fixed — just be polite about it.
## Lack Of Information
**If there's a muse/verse/etc. you want more info on, *tell me***. I struggle to find focus where getting everything filled in is concerned, when the only thing I have to go by is how much interaction any given character is getting and in what verse(s). So those things inadvertently get prioritised, while everything else is sidelined initially, which I am aware can lead to people being hesitant to interact with it then.

But if I don't know there's any active interest in it, I don't know to actually try to focus on it. So ask questions. Request that I get the info up here on the site. I *want* to get everything available, but I'm already working at a disadvantage thanks to AuDHD and my chronic illnesses, so knowing there's interest will help give me direction when I actually feel up to working on things.



[^1]: That *don't* fall into the realm of "being a dick" — any and all anon hate is screen capped and mocked privately with my friends, while the messages themselves are blocked and/or reported.

[^2]: I hold off on filling these until I'm certain I'm not going to be sending any other asks so I may send up to 10 at one time. I do *not* expect you to answer all of them, especially not all at once - I am only trying to provide you with options and variety. Feel free to delete anything you're not interested in doing.

[^3]: This is made even worse when there is a lack of proper sentence case and punctuation, though I can usually tolerate it so long as paragraph breaks are used properly.
