## Post Formatting
> [!warning]- Regarding Accessible Formatting
> I use a series of userscripts and stylesheets to make the tumblr dashboard accessible to me, and without them, I often risk triggering a migraine just by scrolling past certain posts (typically those with double and/or multiple spaced text). These codes will be made available in the near future for everyone else to have access to as well.
### Text Formatting
*What I use for formatting versus what I actually see on my display is not always the same thing, thanks to the stylesheets and userscripts I use. Tumblr's default font sizes for both regular and small text are uncomfortable for me to read, so I have made adjustments to both via stylesheets.*

| Formatting | Style Used By Ziggy                               | Accessibility? |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | :------------: |
| Spacing    | Single Spaced Only                                |   Userscript   |
| Text Size  | Tumblr Default + Small Text for inline footnotes. |   Stylesheet   |
| Font Style | Tumblr Default                                    |   Stylesheet   |
| Font Color | Tumblr Default                                    |   Stylesheet   |
### Other Post Details
*In terms of icons and graphics, I don't care what others use, unless you make a habit of using flashing gifs, at which point I may not be able to interact with you if it proves to be a problem with my migraines.*

*In terms of the actual text, please be sure to use proper paragraph breaks and sentence case, as the lack of such often makes it impossible for me to read, between the constant low level headaches that I have (not including the migraine spikes), and the ADHD making large single blocks of text often impossible to keep up with where I am in them.*[^2]

# Verses & AUs
## Canon-Based Verses & AUs 
- *Includes **Canon Typical** & **Canon Divergent AUs***
- These are the standard verses that take place within the muse's origin fandom universe, whether sticking closer to whatever the muse's personal canon (ie *Canon Typical*) is, or being an alternate variant of such (ie *Canon Divergent AUs*)
## Fandom Specific AUs 
- *Includes various crossover AUs*
- These verses are where my muse's backstory is rewritten to fit them appropriately into another fandom's universe, as if they were *native* to that universe instead of their origin fandom — *in other words: **just like anyone else's Fandom AUs***
## Trapped In Another World AUs 
- *Includes various universe displacement AUs*
- Typically verses where my muse finds themselves in another fandom's universe by one means or another, and their (likely impossible) mission to find a way back home while trying to survive in an unfamiliar world.
## Other Verses & AUs
- *Mostly future proofing*
- Occasional verses/AUs that just don't quite fit into the other categories.
## Private Verses & AUs
- *Includes private Dynamic/Ship Verses & AUs — not limited to romantic shipping*
- *Most commonly reserved for Mains, Best Friends Call Members, & shipping partners*
- **Often plotted verses/AUs & dynamics/ships**, so if we've done a lot of plotting, or have developed dynamics/ships, I may switch the interactions to private verses so that I can more easily keep separate notes for the progression of the interactions and any verse/interactions specific divergences and/or plotting that we've established.


[^1]: That *don't* fall into the realm of "being a dick" — any and all anon hate is screen capped and mocked privately with my friends, while the messages themselves are blocked and/or reported.

[^2]: This is made even worse when there is a lack of proper sentence case and punctuation, though I can usually tolerate it so long as paragraph breaks are used properly.
