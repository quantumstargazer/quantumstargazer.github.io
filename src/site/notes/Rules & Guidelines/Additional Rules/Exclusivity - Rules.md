# Mutuals Only Exclusivity

**My blog is *selective* and *21+ & mutuals only*,** meaning I *only* follow blogs that I want to write with, that also meet the criteria of the writer behind it being 21 years or older, with such being stated somewhere on their blog and/or in their rules.

> [!guideline]- Limited Non-Mutual Interactions Allowed
>
> I *only* roleplay with mutuals, but I do allow for *some* non-mutual interactions via memes and prompts that are tagged "**Open To Everyone**" — these may be sent in by *anyone*, so long as you're 18 years or older, as my blog *is* rated for mature audiences only, and anything regarding mature and/or adult themes being sent anonymously will simply *not* be answered.

## Mains & Exclusives
**I *do* have Mains and very rare Exclusives on my blog.** I also have the Best Friends Call Members, and Ships & Dynamics Partners, that also gain priority for interactions, as these are the people I often interact with the most.

# Other People's Exclusivity

## No Exclusives On Follow
**Do not make my muses your exclusives simply based on your following following my blog.** This makes me extremely uncomfortable when we have not even interacted, especially given how I only choose exclusives from established roleplay partners and do not expect that exclusivity to be mutual unless agreed upon out-of-character.
## Close Friends Only For Exclusives
**If we're not *extremely* close friends out-of-character, my muses are *not* available to be your exclusives.** I am not willing to be near *anyone's* exclusive portrayal of any given canon and/or canon-inspired muse, largely in part due to the fact that my activity is often so sporadic, it would not only be unfair to you to limit yourself in that way, but also unfair to me for you trying to place that expectation of availability on me, which I would not be able to guarantee to be able to maintain.
