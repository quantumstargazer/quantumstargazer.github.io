# Blacklist Tags Requested
## Tag Format
Please tag using one or more of the following formats:
- **content cw** 
- **content** 

> [!guideline]- Why only these formats?
> I am chronically ill and disabled, so blacklisting *literal dozens* of variants for just *one warning* is exhausting, and not something I can do, when people constantly find new ways of making their content/trigger warning tags "unique" to their blog.
> 
> If you use any other format, and regularly post about anything that I have actively requested to be blacklisted, I may opt to not follow and/or interact with you instead.

## Content Warnings Needed
In cases where it's requested to be *at least warned about*, so long as you state in your rules and/or pinned post that the content may occur on your blog, then that's fine — it's just not something I want to effectively be jumpscared with without any form of warning whatsoever.

### Real Life Events
This is my *escapism* blog — I have a separate account for things involving politics and whatnot, and for the most part, am more on bluesky and reddit than on tumblr for such — so I don't wish to see politics and the world being its dumpster fire self when I'm just trying to focus on playing dolls in order to forget about it all for a little while.

# Migraine Triggers
**Double and/or multiple spaced text can trigger my migraines**, though I do use a userscript to counteract this on the desktop (which is the only way I can follow and/or interact with anyone who uses such as their aesthetic, even if they don't use it in interactions with me). 

However, I do rely on the mobile app as well, so please tag posts with this aesthetic with any of the following tags — they're all blacklisted, so whatever is easiest for you to remember is fine.

| blacklisted tags to use     |

| migraine trigger cw         |
