# The Actual Rules
> [!attention]- Read Rules Before Following
> I *actively block* people who obviously did not read my rules before following me first — typically for their being under the age of 21, and/or their blog containing banned content such as fandoms, faceclaims, &/or tropes & themes.

**Be sure to check the [[Rules & Guidelines/Additional FAQ/Do's & Don't's - FAQ\|Do's & Don't's of Interacting]] before you actually start interacting.**

# Don't Be A Dick
This *should* got without saying, *and yet...*[^1]

# 21+ & Mutuals Only
> [!caution]- Viewer Discretion Is Advised
> Most of my fandoms are *literally* **rated M for Mature Audiences**, and as such my blogs and wiki are rated the same. See [[Rules & Guidelines/Additional FAQ/Mature Audiences Only - FAQ\|Mature Audiences Only - FAQ]] for additional information, including a list of content that you may need to be aware of regarding squicks and triggers.

> [!rule]- Must Be 18+ To Follow
> I *hard block* any minors — as well as any blogs who do not list an age at all — who follow me. I do *not* roleplay with anyone under the age of 21, however, so if you are 18 to 20, you are welcome to follow, but I will *not* be writing with you until you are at least 21.

If you don't have an age range that actively states you are *at least **21+*** listed on your blog and/or in your rules, I *will not* follow you, nor will I write roleplay with you. I am in my early 40s, and just simply do not wish to write with anyone younger than US drinking age at this point.

# Curate Your Own Dash
> [!rule]- Regarding Others' "Dead Dove: Do Not Eat" Content Warnings
> 
> **I do *not* follow anyone whose *only* warning for their blog consists of "*Dead Dove: Do Not Eat*" without covering *what* topics, themes, tropes, etc. are likely to be found on their blog.** 
> 
> If the only content warning you provide for your blog consists of "*Dead Dove: Do Not Eat*", then I am going to assume that you write the content that I refuse to engage with at all and typically *hard block* blogs that explicitly roleplay scenes involving rape, sexual assault, Alpha/Beta/Omega dynamics, etc., whether it's true to your blog or not. This will most likely result in my blocking you outright rather than investigating further to see whether or not I might want to interact with you.
> 
> Without any explanation, "*Dead Dove: Do Not Eat*" as effective as saying "*Warning: Consider Yourself Warned*" while inviting people to potentially walk into a nuclear reactor. It is meant to be a warning of "don't blame me if you find content here you didn't like because you didn't read the warning labels provided" — if you don't provide those warnings, then you don't get to complain when people don't want to interact with you at all instead of risking that content they're sensitive to may appear on your blog.

## Rated for Mature Audiences Only
**My blog is intended for [[Rules & Guidelines/Additional FAQ/Mature Audiences Only - FAQ\|Mature Audiences Only]] and is unsuitable for anyone under the age of 18.** All three of my primary fandoms are *similarly rated* — Baldur's Gate, Dragon Age, and Mass Effect are *all* **ESRB Rated M for Mature**. Canon-typical mature themes, violence, sexual content, etc. will all be present on the blog *and* as part of this wiki, and will *not* always be tagged, given the extent in which some topics are integral to the source material on a whole. As such, [[Rules & Guidelines/Additional FAQ/Mature Audiences Only - FAQ#Viewer Discretion Is Advised\|Viewer Discretion Is Advised]].
## Don't Like? Don't Follow.
If you don't like me, my muses, my verses, my blog, etc., then *just don't follow me* — in fact, if you feel that strongly about any of these things, you should probably *hard block* me and *keep me blocked* [^2] instead, so as to keep my content off your dash.
## Hard Block Only - No Soft Block
If you feel the need to block me at all for any reason, *hard block* me, even if you typically only soft block. I am unable to reliably remember if someone has simply soft blocked me instead, and may refollow if I find your blog again in the future, being completely unable to remember that I had followed you in the past. [^2]

# Additional Rules & Guidelines May Apply
## Additional Rules
- [[Rules & Guidelines/Additional Rules/Blacklist Tags - Rules\|Blacklist Tags]] - *content that needs to be tagged*
- [[Rules & Guidelines/Additional Rules/Exclusivity - Rules#Mains & Exclusives\|Mains & Exclusives]] - *regarding my own exclusivity*
- [[Rules & Guidelines/Additional Rules/Exclusivity - Rules#Other People's Exclusivity\|Other People's Exclusivity]] - *important if you practice exclusivity*
## Guidelines
Because the [[Rules & Guidelines/Guidelines\|Guidelines]] are not entirely universal, depending on which fandoms someone is or isn't interested in, how they may wish to interact (for example: whether or not they have any interest in shipping), etc., these are listed *separate* from the actual rules.

That said, when the guidelines *do* apply to you, they *are* considered rules *for you*, though I may be more willing to make exceptions on an individual basis, but this should not be considered the standard, nor should it be expected of me. It is extremely rare that I make exceptions for *anyone*, but it has been known to happen occasionally.

[^1]: Given that I only write with those who are 21 years or older, if you've reached *that point* of your life and *still* don't know how to be a decent human being, then I truly would rather you go elsewhere, because I don't have the time nor the energy to deal with that kind of bullshit.

[^2]: I have severe memory issues due to various comorbid medical conditions, including a traumatic brain injury, so I sincerely *cannot* be relied on to remember if you merely unfollowed &/or soft blocked me. It is for the best that I simply *remain blocked*, and that if you move to a new blog in the future, *especially* if you change your username, that you continue to block me from the new blog(s) as well.

[^3]: If pregnancy becomes a part of any interaction, the active labor and childbirth will be time skipped to when the baby has arrived and has been cleaned up — *no exceptions*.

[^4]: I don't care *how anti-JK Rowling* you are — I will *not* follow or interact with you if you have any Harry Potter muses or verses/AUs on your blog. If we are mutuals, and you add such muses and/or verses/AUs in the future, I will break mutual status by hard blocking you. There will be *no exceptions* to this rule.

[^5]: If they have *genuine face acting roles*, such as would be the case with someone like David Bowie in Labyrinth (1986), then they're fine. Cameos *do not count*, especially in the case of Youtubers.

[^6]: If you use any of these faceclaims and follow me first, I will immediately outright block you — not simply to keep these faceclaims off my dash, but because at that point it is quite obvious that you didn't even bother reading my rules at all.
