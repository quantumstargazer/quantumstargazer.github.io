# Things You Should Do
- **Send me unexpected IC asks at any time** - No meme prompts necessary! Just send your muses my way!
- **Send prompts/memes at any time** - Prompts/memes never expire, and the inbox is always open.
- **Add extra context to any prompts/memes** - If you have thoughts on the context in which the prompts occur, absolutely feel free to add it as a note in the ask when sending it — I answer all asks as text posts for easier continuation as threads, so I can leave any additional notes out of it if requested and/or marked as private for the context.
- **Reverse any prompts/memes** - Whether the original post suggests it or not, you can *always* request a reverse on a prompt, *including* sentence starters (though I will use my judgement as to whether or not my muse would actually say the line, in that case, but I can usually manage it).
- **Write me random starters** - So long as we're mutuals, I *want* to write with you. If you're in the mood to write starters, absolutely feel free to write one or more for my muse(s). No need to wait for me to respond to a starter call.
- **Reply to my open starters** - That's *literally* what they're there for, after all! So long as we're mutuals, you're good to go. They are *not* just for new mutuals and/or people who haven't started interacting yet.
- **Fill out the interest forms** - This will make interactions go a lot more smoothly all around, truly.
- **Take inspiration from my AUs** - I'm a firm supporter of transformative works, so absolutely take inspiration from my work.
- **Ask questions about my muses, their verses, &/or AUs** - I'm always happy to ramble about things to satisfy others' curiosity about these things.
- **Read the muse & verse info** - This is *really important*, since while I say things are "canon-typical", that does *not* mean they're canon-compliant. I don't expect you to remember each and every little detail, but some things are big enough to throw things off course if you assume it's the same as in canon when it's not. A "Quick Guide To Interactions" is added to the bottom of all dossiers and verse details to assist with this.
- **Ask to start over** - If you're not happy with the direction things are going in within our interactions, feel free to ask to start over. We can plot things out a little to figure out the direction to move things in from there.
- **Tell me if you want to ship** - I ship with chemistry, but that doesn't mean I can't handle hearing your wants for a future ship and/or dynamic. It just gives us something to build towards if we're both mutually interested in the same thing there.
- **Add me on discord** - If we are mutuals, you can always add me on discord (*lefae639605*) to chat/plot/whatever.
- **Scream at me in discord at all ungodly hours** - Seriously, I rarely sleep, so chances are online anyway, regardless of what timezone you're in.
- **Randomly drop plot ideas on me whenever** - Just be forewarned that I may take them and turn them into a starter with little to no further enabling.
- **Like and comment ~~and subscribe~~ on headcanons or thoughts about muses** - This will truly make my day.

# Things You Should NOT Do
- **Don't be a dick** - This is ultimately what all of the rules & guidelines boil down to.
- **Don't send anonymous hate** - Anon is a *privilege*, not a right. I keep it on for prompts/memes, and the socially anxious. Not for dicks to be assholes. If you send anon hate, know that it will be screencapped and shared and mocked in private among my friends, while the ask itself will be reported to tumblr for harassment.
- **Don't follow without at least reading the [[Rules & Guidelines/Actual Rules\|Actual Rules]] bits** - Seriously, this has become *that much* of an issue...
- **Don't interact without reading the rules & guidelines** - It will inevitably become obvious you didn't read them, and chances are that I will likely simply block you, depending on the severity of the lines crossed as a result.
- **Don't assume I am my muses** - Honestly, [just read this psa](https://gazingintoquantumstars.tumblr.com/post/795869211991900160) for more on this one.
- **Don't reblog things you're not a part of** - This *especially* goes for roleplay threads, "missing scenes" (ficlets that are tied to specific ships &/or dynamics), headcanons, verse details, etc. If you're not *actively tagged in them*, they are not for you to reblog without my express permission.
- **Don't use my blog as your resource** - I'm good at finding cool shit, but *please* reblog from the source and/or the sideblogs that I myself am most likely reblogging from, rather than spamming my roleplay notifications. Mutuals actively interacting with me have more leeway and *can* reblog directly from me, just don't go overboard.
- **Don't feed my writing into any AI** - This is theft and a blatant copyright violation, and you *will* be blocked and reported.
- **Don't use AI to write &/or create images for me** - I want to be creative with *people*, not machines.
- **Don't softblock me — *only hardblock* if you feel the need to block** - If you feel the need to get me off your dash, *outright hardblock me*. My memory cannot be trusted to remember who to avoid refollowing, so it's better to just outright block me and *keep me blocked* instead.
- **Don't take it personally if I block you** - Again, my memory is absolute shit, so I end up blocking liberally for a wide range of reasons, most of which don't have anything to with with the individuals personally.
- **Don't assume interactions are in the same universe** - Like, sure, between the same muse pairing with the same mun, a *lot* of them might be, if they're under the same verse tag, at least. But something with Mun A is *always* in a separate universe from anything with Mun B, unless we're mutual mutuals who have plotted a shared universe together, but those are exceptionally rare cases, and honestly not likely to happen.
- **Don't assume anything &/or everything I write is "*canon accurate*"** - I rely *heavily* on canon divergence, headcanons, mod integration, etc. I enjoy the hell out of a wide range of AUs, crossovers, etc. Canon is my sandbox, and I will destroy and rebuild it as I please.
- **Don't write my muses for me** - This pertains to *their dialogue, thoughts, feelings, introspection, etc.* It is safe to assume that, if I don't write them resisting an action such as following your muse to another room, being touched, etc., that it is accepted as having occurred without having to explicitly write the action from their point of view. What's *not* accepted is you deciding for me how my muse feels, thinks, react emotionally and/or psychologically, etc.
- **Don't panic** - And always know where your towel is.
