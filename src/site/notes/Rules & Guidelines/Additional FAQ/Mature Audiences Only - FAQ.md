# Rated M for Mature Audiences Only
> [!rule]- Must Be 18+ To Follow
> I *hard block* any minors — as well as any blogs who do not list an age at all — who follow me. I do *not* roleplay with anyone under the age of 21, however, so if you are 18 to 20, you are welcome to follow, but I will *not* be writing any roleplay interactions with you or your muses until you are at least 21.

My blogs and everything therein (including this wiki) are intended for mature audiences only, and as such I *only* follow and interact with those who are **21 years or older**. My primary fandoms are similarly rated, and so this should be taken into account prior to deciding whether or not to follow me.
## Mature & Sexual Content Present
Explicit mature themes, including sexual content, are marked via the community label system.

Sexually suggestive and explicit content is tagged and/or is placed under a cut. The tags for blacklisting are:
- **usft cw** (*general catch-all tag for both suggestive and explicit content*)
- **lemons cw** (*sexually explicit content — ie full on sex scenes and the like*)
- **limes cw** (*sexually suggestive content — ie things up to and including fades to black*)

# Viewer Discretion Is Advised

[^1]: *Highly Selective Partners Only* — I am *extremely* selective about who I will write any kind of kink content and themes with, due to the nature of the content itself. But there *are* people with whom I write it, and not every aspect of it is consistently tagged with content warnings.

[^2]: There are some dynamics in *private verses* where the consent may appear dubious from an outside perspective, but the *plotting* behind the scenes has ensured both muses are, in fact, fully consenting to any such sexual encounters, and/or they may be roleplaying themselves because they're kinky bastards that way.
