# Non-Roleplayers

---
# Following
Non-roleplayers *are* welcome to follow, if they wish, but I will *not* follow back. I only follow other independent roleplay blogs with whom I wish to write with, whose writers are 21+ years old, and whose own rules are compatible with my own.

# Interacting
## Things Okay To Do
- Ask about the characters I write
- Ask about my characters' verses/AUs
- Ask about my headcanons for my characters
- Send prompts/memes tagged with "**Open To Everyone**"
- Like (heart) *most* of the posts on my blog with the exceptions listed below
## Things NOT To Do
- Like (heart) open starters (ie posts tagged with "**Open Starter**" that also have "*open — mutuals only*" in the original post itself)
- Like (heart) interaction calls (ie posts tagged with "**Interaction Call** and/or "**Interest Tracker**" — these posts are for my mutuals only)
- Reblogging *anything* from my blog — reblogging  any in character writing is grounds for *immediate blocking*
