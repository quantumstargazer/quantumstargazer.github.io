# Interaction Forms - Guidelines
> [!info]+ Request Interaction At Any Time
> These forms are here to let you **request interaction at any time**, whether I'm actively on the dash or not (I lurk way more than it appears, since I don't really post from mobile, but I do read and draft things while afk from my desktop).

> *Links to the forms can be found on the* [[Quantum Stargazer Wiki\|homepage]]*.*

# Starter Call
This is the *only* way I accept *requests* for me to write starters where you can specify the muse and/or verse, as well as any length preference, and space to also mention any plot ideas that you might have.

# Inbox Call
If you'd like me to send you some prompts &/or memes to your inbox, *especially* from specific muses and/or out-of-character stuff. This is especially useful if you don't reblog memes regularly, and so you can actively request that I come send things from what you've reblogged previously.
