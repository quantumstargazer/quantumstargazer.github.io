# Mass Effect - Guidelines

---
# Integrating Andromeda

**TBA**

# Unnamed Shepard
In cases where Shepard is an ambiguous NPC, I default to the following: 

- *pronouns:* She/Her/Herself
- *class:* Sentinel (*medic*)
- *morality:* Paragade (*85/15*)

# Destroy Ending Only
In terms of roleplay, I *only* write with the intention of it being the Destroy Ending (or, theoretically, the Ignore Ending, where the cycle continues because Shepard is no longer in the galaxy to stop the Reapers).

However, I rely heavily on canon-divergence where the ending is concerned, much like those found in the Happy Ending mods. So while the Reapers are destroyed, the following is also true: 
## Ending Divergences
- **EDI survives** - she may have been temporarily knocked out and/or may require repairs before she's fully functional again, but she *is* alive. 
- **The Geth survive** - like EDI, they were likely temporarily knocked offline and/or may need repairs before they are fully functional again.
- **Shepard survives & is recovered by crew** - Shepard's MIA status is temporary, with the crew being insistent on searching for them after having lost them once before, refusing to believe they're dead again until they see them for themselves.
