# Communications

---
# Discord
**Discord is my current primary means of communication for out-of-character chat, plotting, etc.**[^1] *Mutuals* can add me at any time — my handle is available in the pinned post of my blog immediately under the cut.
## Private Server Available Upon Request
If you want a private 1-to-1 server for plotting, let me know. I have a template built already that can be used to help get things started, and can be adjusted to better suit our needs as necessary (the default structure works better for some people than it does others, so tweaks are made as necessary once we actually start using it).

# Tumblr Inbox
**Tumblr inbox is always open, 24/7, whether I'm active or not.** I have webhooks *and* email notifications turned on for inbox things, so I am much more likely to see inbox messages pretty quickly, even if I'm not always available to respond to them all right away. 

---
# Tumblr IMs
**Tumblr IMs are inaccessible for me, so I cannot use them as a primary source of communication.** Notifications for such are also often broken af for me thanks to having multiple devices *and* tumblr tabs open at all times, so do *NOT* send time sensitive things to me via IM, as I will likely *not* see it — it's better to send time sensitive things directly to my inbox and/or via discord instead.

IMs are fine in cases of just sending a quick link or a simple one-off message that may or may not even need a reply (especially if it's not time sensitive), but if you want to actually talk, plot, or whatever, it cannot be through tumblr's IMs.


[^1]: Given the privacy concerns involved therein, this may change in the near future if a suitable replacement can be found *and* agreed upon by the majority of users. As it is, I rely *heavily* on Better Discord extensions to make even discord accessible for myself, so finding a suitable replacement is much more difficult, especially since I'm not looking for voice or video, and just need a reliable means of having searchable forum-like chat structures for organisation where servers are concerned.
