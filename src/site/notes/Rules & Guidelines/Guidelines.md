# Guidelines

> [!attention]- Read Rules Before Following
> 
> If you haven't done so already, you should read the [[Rules & Guidelines/Actual Rules\|Actual Rules]] before following. These guidelines are only an expansion of that and may not apply to *everyone*, depending on fandoms, interaction preferences, interest in shipping, etc., unlike the rules themselves.

> [!guideline] Blanket Permissions
> 
> See [[Rules & Guidelines/Additional Guidelines/Blanket Permissions - Guidelines\|Blanket Permissions]] for what is allowed without having to ask or wait for posts prompting any of the things that are stated as being always open to mutuals.

# Interactions
## Continuity
I prefer to have a sense of continuity in the majority of my in character interactions. While strict one shots have their time and place, they're not what I really enjoy for the long term, allowing dynamics to build over time through in-character interactions and out-of-character plotting.
### Separate Multi-Verse Continuities
This continuity is based on an *individual partner basis* — the continuity with one partner between our muses ***does not*** have an effect on the continuity between muses with another partner, even if they fall under the same general verse tag.

## Starters
### Random Starters
I do, on occasion, write random, unprompted starters for people, but *usually* this is reserved for my Mains and the Best Friends Call Members. So if you'd like me to just send stuff at you randomly, please fill out the **Best Friends Call form** to give me *permission* to do so.
#### Write Starters For Me Whenever
**This is blanket permission for *you* to write starters for me whenever you're interested in doing so.** I don't always catch every starter call that comes across the dash, and my anxiety often can interfere in my interacting with them even when I do see them. 

> [!guideline] Automatic Starter Calls
> **So if you're hoping that I'll like your starter call, please just take this as permission to say that I did so and write me a starter.** If you want me to narrow down muses or anything, hit me up on discord or in my inbox, and I'll get back to you as soon as I'm able.

### Requesting Starters
You can request for me to write starters for your muses from mine *at any time* by filling out the **Starter Call form** linked in the pinned post and/or on the homepage of this site.

> [!guideline] Form Required To Request Starters
>
> The form is very minimal, but is easier for me to keep track of what has and has not been filled than posts with "*like this post for a starter*", especially since I prefer it when people actually specify which muses and/or verses they want starters from.
>
>
>
> The form *does* offer a "*Ziggy's Choice*" option for those who aren't picky and/or are feeling indecisive, though I may be slower to fill such requests if I don't have any direction whatsoever to work from.

### Open Starters 
I have dozens of open starters available, which can be replied to at any time, regardless of how long ago I posted it, and/or if it already has replies to it. I try to remember to move each reply to a new text post for thread tracking purposes (or may just repost the starter if I forget so I can carry on the thread to the original post).
#### For Mutuals Only
Open Starters are for *mutuals only*, as is indicated in the starter post itself. Beyond that, they are rarely limited in any other way, but please be sure to read the tags before replying if there are any limits or restrictions mentioned. 
#### Customized Upon Request
If the starter doesn't *quite* fit for your muse, verse, etc., I am more than happy to rewrite it as a closed starter for you instead. All you have to do is ask (either through discord, tumblr IMs, or the inbox) — just be sure to include the link to the original starter so I know which one it is you want me to base a closed starter on for you. 

## Inbox
You can send asks/prompts/memes/etc. to the inbox on either [quantumstargazer](https://quantumstargazer.tumblr.com/ask) and/or [gazingintoquantumstars](https://gazingintoquantumstars.tumblr.com/ask)[^1].
### Reverse Prompts/Memes
You are *always* welcome to reverse any meme and/or prompts (*including sentence starters*), simply by stating that you want it *reversed*, whether the original meme/prompt mentions the option in it or not. 

We're here to have fun, so if something fits better if it's *my muse* doing or saying the thing instead of yours (or vise versa, depending on the meme/prompt), then I'm game for flipping the script regardless of what the original meme/prompt poster intended.
### Adding Context To Memes/Prompts
You are *always* welcome to add context and/or expand on any meme and/or prompt (*including sentence starters*). In fact, it helps a great deal whenever someone *does* if they have something in particular in mind. 

This is *especially* true for things like indicating tone, where you might imagine them saying something one way, but I might interpret it another way, as I can't always locate the original prompt/meme for the original context, if any was given at all.
### Continue As Threads
You are *always* welcome to continue answered in character prompts/memes as threads. I answer most asks as new text posts, and will tag these as "**Closed Starter**", along with a thread tracking tag[^2], if I anticipate it to potentially continued as a thread.

> [!guideline] Answered As Text Posts
> As I *always* turn text-based asks into text posts rather than publishing the original ask, if you mention you want any part of the ask kept private (do so *in the ask itself* so that it doesn't get lost in chats), I will simply not copy that part of the message into the text post when I actually publish it.

### Prompts Never Expire
There is no expiration date on *most* memes/prompts/etc. (I might side-eye you if you send a winter holiday meme in the July, though), and they can be found on both [quantumstargazer](https://quantumstargazer.tumblr.com/) and [gazingintoquantumstars](https://gazingintoquantumstars.tumblr.com/), and can be sent to either inbox.

> [!info] Regarding gazingintoquantumstars
> **The archive, gazingintoquantumstars, is a sideblog** where I reblog memes/prompts/etc to in order to reblog a smaller selection to my roleplay blog. 
> 
> **If you can't find anything in my rp blog's prompts tag that strikes your fancy, try the sideblog instead**, as there is a wider selection there, and is broken down even further by types of prompts/memes than simply IC or OOC like my roleplay blog's tags.
**
### Include Full Prompt When Sending
I am not always able to fill memes and/or prompts right away, so please be sure to include the *full prompt* when sending anything that isn't simply a sentence starter (and/or *include a link to the meme* itself so I can find it later for the context).

> [!guideline] Repeated Emojis & Mistaken Prompts For Sentence Starters
> This is *especially* true for **emoji memes**[^4], as well as anything along the lines of **"*Send 'This is an example' for a starter about whatever the prompt is for*" style memes**, which are often easily confused for sentence starters if the full prompt isn't included.
> 
> When the meme is along the lines of **"Send ♥️ for whatever the prompt is for"**, please send the *whole line of the prompt*, as any emoji meme is impossible to track down which one it's for unless received immediately after it posts, and even then, things can easily get mixed up with another recently reblogged prompt.

### Send Any Time
**You do not have to wait for me to be active on the dash to send things!** My inbox is always open, unless I have *literally* turned it off.

I end up spending a lot of time on mobile, and since I rely heavily on userscripts and stylesheets for tumblr rp, in addition to X-Kit Rewritten, you won't see me making many posts, even OOC ones, from mobile. But I can work on things from mobile and then transcribe them later on the desktop for posting, so please do send me as many things as you want.

# Ships & Dynamics
## Multi-Shipping
Ships (as well as dynamics) are not Highlanders — there can be more than one. **There is no cheating** (*unless specifically plotted and agreed upon ooc*, and even then it is *strictly* with regards to NPCs and *not* other people's portrayals, as I am *not* interested in interacting in most group verses and/or AU scenarios involving multiple muns in a shared verse setting[^5]).
## Chemistry
Chemistry is *paramount* when it comes to shipping and many dynamics. This can be achieved through in character interactions and/or out of character plotting and approved headcanons, but it still needs to exist.
### Flirting ≠ Forced Shipping
While I'm *always* willing to test the waters with letting the characters have some flirtatious banter, progressing into anything remotely serious between them needs to have chemistry, whether it is built in and/or out of character.

**Your muse can always flirt with mine**, but that doesn't mean it will always be reciprocated (or that they even recognize they're being flirted with — some can be a bit oblivious on that front).
## Dynamics
### Platonic
Platonic dynamics are *still* chemistry based for *progression* — strangers, acquaintances, casual friends, coworkers, family, etc. are all baseline starting points for platonic dynamics, but the deeper the connection, the more important chemistry becomes.
### Queerplatonic
Queerplatonic[^6] dynamics *are welcome*, and are dependent on chemistry in much the same way of romantic dynamics. This goes *beyond* being close friends and/or even best friends, and is very much akin to what you'd expect from romantic dynamics, but without the actual romance side of things.
### Familial
Familial dynamics (whether by blood, by choice, by circumstance, found family, team as family, etc.) are welcome, and are chemistry based as everything else is. Non-canon children of any muse will require ooc discussion, though I am *extremely* selective when it comes to interacting with such muses (it's not to say I won't, but I've had some bad experiences with it in the past, so I'm much more picky about it now).
### Antagonistic
Antagonistic dynamics (where the intention is for them to *stay* that way for the long term, as with villains and such) are welcome, but may require ooc discussion and plotting to establish boundaries and the like — *especially* if there's any sexual encounters involved in the dynamic.
## Shipping
### Romanic Ships
Romantic ships are *strictly* chemistry based — if the muses don't have chemistry, then a romantic ship isn't likely to develop. At least not without more plotting, and may require a soft reset of their interactions to try again.
### Sexual Ships
Sexual ships — which may be *independent* of a romantic ship, in cases of more casual sexual dynamics — are *also* reliant on chemistry for actual progression, though this may be less necessary for more casual sexual encounters than for other sexual dynamics.
### Smut
**No Ship/Dynamic Required To Start** — While I am open to writing smut, it is *not* my primary focus. But some of my muses are open to more casual sexual encounters than others, so it's not impossible to have smut be a part of the muses' dynamics without there being a need for anything beyond mutual agreement to test things out through in character interactions.

> [!guideline] Spicy Prompts Open To All Mutuals
> This can be done simply my sending a prompt/meme from the ones tagged as "**Spicy**", for both in and/or out of character responses. 
> 
> **Sending such is *not* considered forced shipping** — if I don't feel we're quite there yet, I will simply let the ask hang out in the inbox until a more suitable time to answer it.

# Verses & AUs
## Specify Verse
**I strongly prefer when *you* choose which variant of my muse you wish to interact with.** This largely stems from experience with people frequently dropping interactions without saying a word about doing so because they're not *actually* interested in that muse and/or verse, and rather than just *saying so*, they run the risk of my eventually refusing to interact with them anymore when everything is frequently dropped instead.
### Disinterest Tracker
**If you're not interested in a verse/AU, you need to fill out the Disinterest Tracker and *let me know*.** I won't send anything your way that you actively state you're not interested in, but if you don't *tell me*, and it's not stated in your rules either, then how can I possibly know? I honestly don't have the energy to spare for this kind of behavior. If you can't be upfront about your disinterest in something when I have actively provided a means for you to do so, then we're probably not compatible roleplay partners.
### Default Verses/AUs
I typically default to a muse's canon-based verses and/or their fandom-matched to your muse's verse AUs (ie if your muse is from Baldur's Gate and you're interacting with Isabela Shepard, I will typically use one of her Baldur's Gate AUs unless the interaction is actually set within the Mass Effect universe).
### If Not Specified
In the event that you *don't* specify a verse, I will most likely fall back on one of my muse's default verses. In some cases, I may reach out and specifically request that you specify a verse, if I'm not certain where to go with an interaction otherwise (often as a result of indecision lock where there's too many possibilities).
## Private Verses & AUs
Private Verses & AUs are largely reserved for Mains, Best Friends Call Members, and partners with whom I'm shipping with and/or our muses have strong dynamics together. 

Generally speaking, if I'm likely to want and/or need to have room to where I can make notes to track progression of the pairing's dynamics together, then I'll probably tag it as a private verse and have dedicated note pages to keep track of such things on here.
### Interacting In Other Muns' Private Verses & AUs
It is *exceptionally rare* that I am willing to let anyone other than the intended partner interact within any private verses, largely due to the fact that even mutual mutuals can one day *not be* mutuals anymore, and so there is the matter of untangling the mess then when it comes to dissolving those connections.

As such, private verses are most likely available *only* for their intended partner that is actively mentioned in the verse's tag itself.

---
# Plotting
## Improv Roleplay
**I am very much an improv roleplayer.** While I can handle doing some loose plotting to help guide the overall intended path of a dynamic and/or ship, I work best with minimal prompting and simply letting inspiration lead where it may.
## Plotting Dynamics, Ships, Verses, &/or AUs
### Strict Plotters
> [!rule]+ Incompatible Partner for Strict Plotters
> 
> Plotting, for me, *cannot* be a strict railroaded outline — doing such means my brain will decide it's already been written, and the only way it can be written *again* is with changes and divergences made to it. 
> 
> If you are someone who needs to have strict plotting to know *exactly* where things begin, end, and everything that happens in between, we are *not* going to be compatible with each other.

[^1]: Sideblog for archiving any and all of the memes, prompts lists, etc. for personal roleplaying purposes. All memes on the blog are considered "active" and may be sent in no matter how long ago I reblogged it.

[^2]: Tagged as **; partnerurl / partnermuse & mymuse / 000** with the appropriate number for which thread the interaction is.

[^3]: Crossovers are handled from the perspective of *my muse's background* being adjusted to fit into another fandom's setting. This does *not* affect your muse's background in any way.

[^4]: Many of which don't even show up correctly on the desktop, plus emojis get reused between memes all the time, and with no expiration date on how long ago I reblogged something for someone to send it, those emojis are bound to have been used by multiple memes.

[^5]: My social anxiety disorder simply just can't handle it, *especially* if it's involving people that I'm not actively friends with myself. So the likeliness of me agreeing to be a part of a group verse in any way is slim to none, with none being the more likely outcome.

[^6]: A **queerplatonic relationship** is a partnership which does not fit the "*traditional*" models of friendships or romantic relationships. Queerplatonic relationships often have characteristics commonly associated with romantic relationships, such as deep emotional intimacy, prioritization, and commitment, while still defying a "*platonic or romantic*" categorization. Queerplatonic relationships have a flexible dynamic, and each relationship is tailored to the needs of the individuals involved, with no outside societal expectations or guidelines to follow.
