# Guidelines

> [!attention]- Read Rules Before Following
> 
> If you haven't done so already, you should read [[Rules & Guidelines/Actual Rules\|The Actual Rules]] before following. These guidelines are only an expansion of that and may not apply to *everyone*, depending on fandoms, interaction preferences, interest in shipping, etc., unlike the rules themselves.
# Interactions
## Inbox
You can send asks/prompts/memes/etc. to the inbox on either [quantumstargazer](https://quantumstargazer.tumblr.com/ask) and/or [gazingintoquantumstars](https://gazingintoquantumstars.tumblr.com/ask)[^1].
### Reverse Prompts/Memes
You are *always* welcome to reverse any meme and/or prompts (*including sentence starters*), simply by stating that you want it *reversed*, whether the original meme/prompt mentions the option in it or not. 

We're here to have fun, so if something fits better if it's *my muse* doing or saying the thing instead of yours (or vise versa, depending on the meme/prompt), then I'm game for flipping the script regardless of what the original meme/prompt poster intended.
### Adding Context To Memes/Prompts
You are *always* welcome to add context and/or expand on any meme and/or prompt (*including sentence starters*). In fact, it helps a great deal whenever someone *does* if they have something in particular in mind. 

> [!guideline] Answered As Text Posts
> As I *always* turn asks into text posts rather than publishing the original ask, if you mention you want any part of the ask kept private (do so *in the ask itself* so that it doesn't get lost in chats), I will simply not copy that part of the message into the text post when I actually publish it.

### Continue As Threads
You are *always* welcome to continue answered in character prompts/memes as threads. I answer most asks as new text posts, and will tag these as "**Closed Starter**", along with a thread tracking tag[^2], if I anticipate it to potentially continued as a thread.
### Prompts Never Expire
There is no expiration date on *most* memes/prompts/etc. (I might side-eye you if you send a winter holiday meme in the middle of summer, though), and they can be found on both [quantumstargazer](https://quantumstargazer.tumblr.com/) and [gazingintoquantumstars](https://gazingintoquantumstars.tumblr.com/), and can be sent to either inbox.

The latter is a sideblog where I reblog memes/prompts/etc to in order to reblog a smaller selection to my roleplay blog. If you can't find anything in my rp blog's prompts tag that strikes your fancy, try the sideblog instead, as there is a wider selection there, and is broken down even further by types of prompts/memes than simply IC or OOC like my roleplay blog's tags.
### Include Full Prompt When Sending
I am not always able to fill memes and/or prompts right away, so please be sure to include the *full prompt* when sending anything that isn't simply a sentence starter (and/or include a link to the meme itself so I can find it later).

> [!guideline] Repeated Emojis & Mistaken Prompts For Sentence Starters
> This is *especially* true for **emoji memes**[^4], as well as anything along the lines of **"*Send 'This is an example' for a starter about whatever the prompt is for*" style memes**, which are often easily confused for sentence starters if the full prompt isn't included.

### Send Any Time
**You do not have to wait for me to be active on the dash to send things!** My inbox is always open, unless I have *literally* turned it off.

I end up spending a lot of time on mobile, and since I rely heavily on userscripts and stylesheets for tumblr rp, in addition to X-Kit Rewritten, you won't see me making many posts, even OOC ones, from mobile. But I can work on things from mobile and then transcribe them later on the desktop for posting, so please do send me as many things as you want.
## Starters
### Random Starters
I do, on occasion, write random, unprompted starters for people, but *usually* this is reserved for my Mains and the Best Friends Call Members. So if you'd like me to just send stuff at you randomly, please fill out the **Best Friends Call form** to give me *permission* to do so.
### Requesting Starters
You can request for me to write starters for your muses from mine *at any time* by filling out the **Starter Call form** linked in the pinned post and/or on the homepage of this site.

> [!guideline] Form Required To Request Starters
>
> The form is very minimal, but is easier for me to keep track of what has and has not been filled than posts with "*like this post for a starter*", especially since I prefer it when people actually specify which muses and/or verses they want starters from.
>

> The form *does* offer a "*Ziggy's Choice*" option for those who aren't picky and/or are feeling indecisive, though I may be slower to fill such requests if I don't have any direction whatsoever to work from.

# Ships & Dynamics
## Multi-Shipping
Ships (as well as dynamics) are not Highlanders — there can be more than one. **There is no cheating** (*unless specifically plotted and agreed upon ooc*, and even then it is *strictly* with regards to NPCs and *not* other people's portrayals, as I am *not* interested in interacting in most group verses and/or AU scenarios involving multiple muns in a shared verse setting[^5]).
## Chemistry
Chemistry is *paramount* when it comes to shipping and many dynamics. This can be achieved through in character interactions and/or out of character plotting and approved headcanons, but it still needs to exist.
### Flirting ≠ Forced Shipping
While I'm *always* willing to test the waters with letting the characters have some flirtatious banter, progressing into anything remotely serious between them needs to have chemistry, whether it is built in and/or out of character.

**Your muse can always flirt with mine**, but that doesn't mean it will always be reciprocated (or that they even recognize they're being flirted with — some can be a bit oblivious on that front).
## Dynamics
### Platonic
Platonic dynamics are *still* chemistry based for *progression* — strangers, acquaintances, casual friends, coworkers, family, etc. are all baseline starting points for platonic dynamics, but the deeper the connection, the more important chemistry becomes.
### Queerplatonic
Queerplatonic dynamics *are welcome*, and are dependent on chemistry in much the same way of romantic dynamics.
## Shipping
### Romanic Ships
Romantic ships are *strictly* chemistry based — if the muses don't have chemistry, then a romantic ship isn't likely to develop. At least not without more plotting, and may require a soft reset of their interactions to try again.
### Sexual Ships
Sexual ships — which may be *independent* of a romantic ship, in cases of more casual sexual dynamics — are *also* reliant on chemistry for actual progression, though this may be less necessary for more casual sexual encounters than for other sexual dynamics.
### Smut
**No Ship/Dynamic Required To Start** — While I'm not here to write *just* smut, some of my muses are open to more casual sexual encounters than others, so it's not impossible to have smut be a part of the muses' dynamics without there being a need for anything beyond mutual agreement to test things out through in character interactions.

> [!guideline] Spicy Prompts Open To All Mutuals
> This can be done simply my sending a prompt/meme from the ones tagged as "**Spicy**", for both in and/or out of character responses.

# Verses & AUs
## Private Verses & AUs
Private Verses & AUs are largely reserved for Mains, Best Friends Call Members, and partners with whom I'm shipping with and/or our muses have strong dynamics together. 

Generally speaking, if I'm likely to want and/or need to have room to where I can make notes to track progression of the pairing's dynamics together, then I'll probably tag it as a private verse and have dedicated note pages to keep track of such things on here.
### Interacting In Other Muns' Private Verses & AUs
It is *exceptionally rare* that I am willing to let anyone interact within any private verses, largely due to the fact that even mutual mutuals can one day *not be* mutuals anymore, and so there is the matter of untangling the mess then when it comes to dissolving those connections.

As such, private verses are most likely available *only* for their intended partner that is actively mentioned in the verse's tag itself.

# Footnotes
[^1]: Sideblog for archiving any and all of the memes, prompts lists, etc. for personal roleplaying purposes. All memes on the blog are considered "active" and may be sent in no matter how long ago I reblogged it.

[^2]: Tagged as **; partnerurl / partnermuse & mymuse / 000** with the appropriate number for which thread the interaction is.

[^3]: Crossovers are handled from the perspective of *my muse's background* being adjusted to fit into another fandom's setting. This does *not* affect your muse's background in any way.

[^4]: Many of which don't even show up correctly on the desktop, plus emojis get reused between memes all the time, and with no expiration date on how long ago I reblogged something for someone to send it, those emojis are bound to have been used by multiple memes.

[^5]: My social anxiety disorder simply just can't handle it, *especially* if it's involving people that I'm not actively friends with myself. So the likeliness of me agreeing to be a part of a group verse in any way is slim to none, with none being the more likely outcome.
