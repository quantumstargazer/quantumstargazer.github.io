# Quantum Stargazer Wiki
> [!error] Under Emergency Construction
> Site is under emergency construction after the old wiki decided to start suffering from fatal errors on the host's end, so things are going to be a bit chaotic while I try to salvage the data from the old site to add to this one. Please be patient, as I am chronically ill and unable to always dedicate a lot of time and energy to this effort.

> [!WARNING] Testing In Progress
> Great work. Because this message is prerecorded, any observations related to your performance are speculation on our part. Please disregard any undeserved compliments.

# Quantum Stargazer
[Quantum Stargazer](https://quantumstargazer.tumblr.com/) is an *Independent*, *Selective*, *21+ & Mutuals Only* Multifandom Multimuse blog featuring canon, canon-based, and original characters from Baldur's Gate, Dragon Age, Mass Effect, & more.
## RP Info
- **Multi-Ship** - Ships are not Highlanders — there can be more than one. And there will be. *There will be.*
- **Multi-Verse** - All [[Muse Info/! Open Muses - Roster\|Open Muses]] have Canon-Based Verses, Fandom Specific AUs, Trapped In Another World AUs, &/or Other Verses & AUs.
- **Extremely Crossover Friendly** - If a verse &/or doesn't exist, so long as I'm even *remotely* familiar with and interested in the fandom, chances are good that I'll add a verse to make it happen.
- **Loose Plotting Only** - Not a heavy or strict planner; if *you are*, then I'm probably not who you want to try to plot with.
- **In Character Posts Immediately** - IC posts are never queued — only prompts, memes, aesthetics, etc. are queued.

> [!ziggy]- Wordy AF - Unapologetically Neurodivergent
> **AuDHD** means ***infodumping*** is likely to occur, and this means my posts, as well as the notes here, are likely to get *wordy*. I tend to try to be mindful of individual paragraph lengths, but there will often be *a lot* of paragraphs and/or bullet points.
> 
> If, for any reason, you are troubled by being expected to *actually read things* in a writing hobby that should, in theory, require at least 50% reading, considering it's collaborative nature, then I'm *probably* not the roleplay partner for you.

# Footnotes
[^1]: Essentially a permanent starter call with benefits — this is the only permanent starter call you will find on my blog. It's mostly a major reliever of social anxiety for me, for having explicit permission to interact.

[^2]: Incorporates Forgotten Realms and D&D/AD&D lore for individual characters as needed, mostly through BG3 mods, but occasionally just additional lore needed to further flesh out the characters.

[^3]: When I am writing Peter Venkman, he is *not* the movie-verse Venkman, but rather the further developed characterization from **The *Real* Ghostbusters** (ie the sharp minded businessman who has a soft spot for kids and little old ladies who remind him of his mom) and it is extremely important that this is respected — failure to do so will likely result in the interactions being dropped.

[^4]: Mostly the Marvel Cinematic Universe, prior to Avengers: Infinity War. In terms of *my* portrayal of Tony Stark, his MCU canon *stops* at Captain America: Civil War, where it then goes fully AU with dimensional travel and franchise swap, as he will be written as part of the DC universe, primarily focused on that of Batman: The Animated Series (as well as most of the animated movies), in addition to some fanmade content to be detailed in Tony's info once I'm ready to actually start writing him again.
