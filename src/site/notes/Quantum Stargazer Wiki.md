# Quantum Stargazer Wiki
> [!WARNING]+ Testing In Progress
> Great work. Because this message is prerecorded, any observations related to your performance are speculation on our part. Please disregard any undeserved compliments.
> 
> > [!error]- Under Emergency Construction
> > Site is under emergency construction after the old wiki decided to start suffering from fatal errors on the host's end, so things are going to be a bit chaotic while I try to salvage the data from the old site to add to this one. Please be patient, as I am chronically ill and unable to always dedicate a lot of time and energy to this effort.

# Quantum Stargazer
[Quantum Stargazer](https://quantumstargazer.tumblr.com/) is an *Independent*, *Selective*, *21+ & Mutuals Only* Multifandom Multimuse blog featuring canon, canon-based, and original characters from Baldur's Gate[^1], Dragon Age, Mass Effect, & more.
## RP Info
- **Multi-Ship** - Ships are not Highlanders — there can be more than one. And there will be. *There will be.*
- **Multi-Verse** - All [[Muse Info/! Open Muses - Roster\|Open Muses]] have Canon-Based Verses, Fandom Specific AUs, Trapped In Another World AUs, &/or Other Verses & AUs.
- **Extremely Crossover Friendly** - If a verse &/or doesn't exist, so long as I'm even *remotely* familiar with and interested in the fandom, chances are good that I'll add a verse to make it happen.
- **Loose Plotting Only** - Not a heavy or strict planner; if *you are*, then I'm probably not who you want to try to plot with.
- **In Character Posts Immediately** - IC posts are never queued — only prompts, memes, aesthetics, etc. are queued.

> [!ziggy]- Wordy AF - Unapologetically Neurodivergent
> **AuDHD** means ***infodumping*** is likely to occur, and this means my posts, as well as the notes here, are likely to get *wordy*. I tend to try to be mindful of individual paragraph lengths, but there will often be *a lot* of paragraphs and/or bullet points.
> 
> If, for any reason, you are troubled by being expected to *actually read things* in a writing hobby that should, in theory, require at least 50% reading, considering its collaborative nature, then I'm *probably* not the roleplay partner for you.

## Blanket Permissions
***Mutuals*** do not have to ask or wait for posts prompting them to do any of the following:
- **Send Prompts/Memes To Inbox**
	- *Reverse Prompts/Memes*
	- *Add Context, Tone Indicators, Etc. To Prompts/Memes*
	- *Continue Answered Asks As Threads*
- **Write Starters For My Muses**
	- *Unprompted Random Starters*

- **Ask To Ship, Plot Dynamics, Etc.**
	- *Message on discord &/or via tumblr inbox*

# Thread Tracking
> [!tracker]- Important Note About Thread Tracking
> ***I do not use the RP Thread Tracker quite as intended.*** Most notably where the Archive and Queue is concerned.
> - Any in character post tagged with "**; partnerurl / partnermuse & my muse / 000**" is intended to be added to the tracker — Havu ([lanternlit](https://lanternlit.tumblr.com)) is helping to make sure everything actually gets tracked.
> - **Only active threads are in the front most view**, so I can keep tabs what I currently have going on — anything else is either marked as Archived or Queued for storage purposes.
> 
> **Threads Inactive For Longer Than 2+ Months**
> - Threads that have been on "*their turn*" for 2+ months are sent to the Archive for storage until it is replied to — these threads are still accessible through the public view's dropdown menu to access Archived threads. 
> 	- I do *not* consider these threads dropped *unless I have updated the title to mark them as such*. If you have outright dropped a thread, *please notify me directly*. This can be done through discord, tumblr IM, and/or the tumblr inbox.
> - Threads that have been on *my turn* for 2+ months are potentially sent to the Queue for storage if they're stuck in drafts due to low muse activity — again, they're still accessible through the dropdown menu to access Queued threads.
> 	- These posts are *not* actually queued, however, as I *never* queue in character posts. It is just a functional way of setting them aside in the tracker so as not to overwhelm me when I know I'm not going to be replying to that post for a while, and it should automatically release it from being marked as queued when I do eventually get it posted.
> 	- Likewise, these threads are also *not dropped* — some muses, or even just some verses for that muse, are simply slower than others, and so interactions may go months without being replied to if I have little to no muse for them at the time.
## Where You Can See What's Tracked
- [Thread Tracker](https://www.rpthreadtracker.com/public/quantumstargazer/qsthreads) - *all threads, regardless of whose turn it is*
- [Their Turn](https://www.rpthreadtracker.com/public/quantumstargazer/qstheirturn) - *only threads that are on someone else's turn*
- [Ziggy’s Turn](https://www.rpthreadtracker.com/public/quantumstargazer/ziggysturn) - *only threads that are on my turn*

> [!guideline]- Regarding Tracking & Dropped Threads
> I *very rarely* drop threads myself simply due to a lack of interest, so this is *not* something you need to worry about, even if it takes me a long time to reply to a thing. I will get to it *eventually*, or I will reach out and let you know that I need to drop it because I'm unable to find a way to continue it.
> 
> If you lose interest in a thread, I would appreciate it if you would *please just let me know* so I can mark it as dropped &/or ended, rather than letting it sit as being archived and still waiting for a potential reply to come in. I'm an avid reader of work-in-progress fics on AO3 — I will wait *literal years* for a continuation, and that *includes* roleplay threads (it's something I've regularly done in the past on my old blogs).
> 
> If you're never going to reply to something, I'd rather just know rather than being expected to *assume* — assumptions make asses out of people, more often than not, and again, I'm neurodivergent AF *and* disabled, so my assumptions are always going to lean to a far kinder **"they're probably just busy/too tired/brainfoggy/etc"** side of things rather than "oh, they've lost interest and I should move on from that thread" that most people seem to assume.

# Interest Forms
> [!rule]- Interest Assumed For All Open Muses
> Unless you fill out the **Disinterest Tracker** to tell me otherwise, if we're mutuals, it's assumed you're interested in interacting with any and *all* of my ***Open Muses*** in any of their canon-based verses and/or their fandom matched verses & AUs.

- [Disinterest Tracker](https://tally.so/r/jaQLWR) - *for telling me who you are* **not** *interested in interacting with*
- [RP Preferences Tracker](https://tally.so/r/rjOV7N) - *for telling me your preferences for interactions, plotting, etc.* 
- [Best Friends Call](https://tally.so/r/eqraq0) - *the closest thing I have to a 'permanent starter call', with benefits*
## Interactions Calls
> [!guideline]- Request Interaction At Any Time
> These forms are here to let you request interaction at any time, whether I'm actively on the dash or not (I lurk way more than it appears, since I don't really post from mobile, but I do read and draft things while afk from my desktop).

- [Starter Call](https://tally.so/r/eqrr8J) - *for requesting that I write a starter for your muse(s)*
- [Inbox Call](https://tally.so/r/NpXXKl) - *for requesting that I send prompts/memes to your inbox*

# Muse Rosters
> [!faq]- Activity Levels Based On Fandom - Not Individual Muse
> - Activity is based on the fandom as opposed to the individual muse.
> - So when Dragon Age is my highest actively, all Dragon Age muses *and* the Dragon Age AUs for my other muses are more likely to have quicker turn arounds than any other muse in any other fandom, whether it is their canon-based verse and/or AU for other fandoms.
> - I do it this way because individual muse actively varies drastically and frequently, whereas fandom actively tends to be centered more on my current hyperfixation, and is slower to change activity levels.

- [[Muse Info/! Open Muses - Roster\|Open Muses]] - *priority muses — available to everyone*
- [[Muse Info/By Request Only - Roster\|By Request Only]] - *available only on request*

- *age:* 40+
> [!example]+ Fandoms

>> [!todo]- Other Fandoms
>> *This is not an extensive list of fandoms I'm interested in &/or familiar with enough to roleplay with. Please note: I don't keep up well with modern media, so don't expect me to be familiar with new things as soon as they come out.*
>> - Addams Family
>> - BioShock
>> - DC (*focus:* Batman: The Animated Series)
>> - Detroit: Become Human
>> - Doctor Who (*Expanded Universe*)
>> - Dungeons & Dragons (*tabletop rpg*)
>> - Elder Scrolls
>> - Fallout
>> - Forgotten Realms (*D&D setting*)
>> - Ghostbusters (*focus:* The ***Real*** Ghostbusters)[^2]

>> - The Stanley Parable
>> - Star Trek (*focus:* Original Series through Voyager)
>> - Stardew Valley
>> - Supernatural



[^1]: Incorporates **Forgotten Realms** and **D&D/AD&D** lore for individual characters as needed, mostly through BG3 mods, but occasionally just additional lore needed to further flesh out the characters.

[^2]: When I am writing Peter Venkman, he is *not* the movie-verse Venkman, but rather the further developed characterization from **The *Real* Ghostbusters** (ie the sharp minded businessman who has a soft spot for kids and little old ladies who remind him of his mom) and it is extremely important that this is respected — failure to do so will likely result in the interactions being dropped.

[^3]: Mostly the Marvel Cinematic Universe, prior to Avengers: Infinity War. In terms of *my* portrayal of Tony Stark, his MCU canon *stops* at Captain America: Civil War, where it then goes fully AU with dimensional travel and franchise swap, as he will be written as part of the DC universe, primarily focused on that of Batman: The Animated Series (as well as most of the animated movies), in addition to some fanmade content to be detailed in Tony's info once I'm ready to actually start writing him again.
