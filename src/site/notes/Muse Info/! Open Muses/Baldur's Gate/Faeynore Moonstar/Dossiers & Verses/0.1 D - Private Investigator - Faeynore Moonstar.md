# Background
## Birth & Early Childhood 
- Born in the small city of Drelagara on the island of Evermeet to a family of moon-horse ranchers
## Childhood & Adolescence 
- TBA
## Adulthood 
- Decided the ranching life was not for her — at least, for the moment — and left Evermeet for Faerûn, where she would establish herself as a private investigator in Baldur's Gate, utilising a variety of trinkets brought with her from the Feywild to aid her in such
- While she typically worked in the private sector, it was not uncommon for her to be pulled into the House of Magistrates' court proceedings when she would produce new evidence for the defendants who sought her aid in proving their innocence
- A few clients ''did'' try to bribe her into fabricating evidence on occasion, though she never did take any such bribe — she at least gained a reputation for being surprisingly trustworthy even by the courts for any evidence she brought forward when she was involved in a case
- She was asked to look into the murder of Magistrate Astarion Ancunín, and when his corpse refused to speak to give her any further insight into what exactly happened to him, only to disappear from the grave after being buried, she found herself unable to let the case go
- Even two centuries after the case had grown cold, with more red tape standing in her way than she had ever encountered in anything else, Faeynore refused to believe that the magistrate's death was as simple as everyone else wanted to believe, ''especially'' when she felt someone was toying with her and providing dozens of false leads over the years

## Things *You* Should Know
> [!wishlist]- Astarion Ancunín — Pre-Established Dynamics
> - Faeynore would have known Astarion in life as a magistrate in Baldur's Gate, though their dynamic was most likely purely professional (unless plotted otherwise). She would have been present for numerous cases involving murder victims, inheritance disputes, etc., where her skill with speaking with the dead often leads to her being a favourite choice for those who hire her to aid them in their case. She ''typically'' worked for the defence in these cases, but could occasionally be coaxed into serving the prosecution under the right circumstances.
> - She was also directly involved in the investigation of Astarion's murder, having gone so far as to try to get his corpse to reveal what it would to her, only for that to fail completely (whether through compulsion or simply the process of being turned, the spell simply doesn't work). When his grave ends up disturbed and is found to be completely empty, she will refuse to let the case go, even when it grows cold after numerous false leads — she suspects someone is toying with her, and privately continues the investigation, even after two centuries of discovering ''nothing'' of what truly happened.
> - She ''will'' immediately know something has changed about Astarion, but while her first instinct is, ironically enough, "vampire", the fact that they're standing in the sunlight will lead to her immediately dismissing that, instead taking his paler than before complexion and red eyes as a potential result of exposure to the Feywild, which would also explain why he hasn't seemed to age any in the last two centuries, especially if he experienced a time deferential between there and Faerûn.

## Things Your Muse *Could* Know
> [!hint]- Unusual Trinket for Speak With Dead
> The trinket that allows Faeynore to cast Speak With Dead allows them to ask *as many questions as they desire*, until they've thoroughly exhausted the conversation, rather than being beholden to the spell's typical five questions. If questioned where they got such a treasure, they'll say it was a gift from someone they had helped over a century ago.
>> [!spoiler]-
>> Faeynore has the Raven Queen's favour, though they themself never sought it out. The trinket was a *gift* after Faeynore inadvertently rescued one of the Raven Queen's favoured warlocks.
