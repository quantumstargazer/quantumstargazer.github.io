# Canon Typical
> [!verse]+ Wandering Dirge
> - *Companion (Non-Party Leader) AU*
> 
> '*Dirge*,' as they've come to be called, has next to no recollection of who they were before they awoke on the Nautiloid with a mind flayer tadpole writhing behind their eye. What little they do know...
> 
> ''**Blood**.''
> 
> Blood calls to them, despite their disgust with the urges they barely manage to hold in check as they struggle to find not only a cure for their tadpole infection, but to also discover just exactly who they are... and why they think everyone would look better as a corpse...
