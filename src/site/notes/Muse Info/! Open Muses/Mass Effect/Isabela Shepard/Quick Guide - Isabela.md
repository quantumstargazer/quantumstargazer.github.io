## Things Your Muse *Could* Know
> [!hint]- Street Rat Turned Spectre
> 
> Isabela doesn't hide the fact that she was orphaned at only 6 years old, or that she grew up on the streets of Earth, running with a gang in order to survive. It's a matter of public record about her, though she doesn't make a habit of *volunteering* the information to people who haven't sought it out on their own either.
> 
> She will only to into *details* of her past with those she is close to who actually bother asking her about them. Otherwise, she might hint at some of the weirder things she got to to as a kid just to mess with people, but never elaborates any further without them being close friends and in private away from others that she doesn't want to know such things about her.

## Things Your Muse Should *Not* Know
> [!attention]- Isabela's Parents
> 
> Isabela's parents vanished when they went to work one day, only to never return. Isabela was only 6 when she was effectively orphaned by this turn of events, and she never has learned the truth of her parents' fate.
>
> Her father was a scientist, and her mother was an engineer. They worked for the same organization, though it will be many years before it comes to light that they were essentially part of the early operations of Cerberus.
> 
> **Pre-Approved Exceptions:**
> - The Illusive Man
> - Saren Arterius 
> - Avitus Rix 
> - Nihlus Kryik
