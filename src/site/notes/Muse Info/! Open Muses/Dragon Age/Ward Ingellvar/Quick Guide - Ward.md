# Universal Guides
## Things *You* Should Know
> [!hint]+ Spirit of Learning
> Ward began their existence as a curious little wisp with a desperate desire to learn, who was nurtured and taught by Wisdom (*Solas, unless plotted otherwise*), and who grew into a proper Spirit of Wisdom. 
> 
> **Risk of Corruption**
> - If corrupted, they may become something akin to the Librarians in the Shattered Library, a spirit of the fear of ignorance.
> - Depending on *when* and how they are at risk of corruption, they could also became a spirit of Spite, for their desperation to learn one specific thing is fueled by spite to prove someone wrong.

## Things Your Muse *Could* Know
> [!hint]- Ghost of the Necropolis
> Ward acquired this moniker as a child for the way they move through the Necropolis so quietly and often unseen, besides maybe tiny barely there glimpses of a flash of shock white hair or deathly silver-white eyes peeking out from behind a pillar, or from behind Vorgoth.
> 
> As they continue this behavior even after they graduate as an apprentice and become a proper Watcher, they never quite leave this moniker behind.

## Things Your Muse Should *Not* Know
> [!attention]- Spirit turned Elf
> (*verse/timeline dependent*)
> 
> - **With very few exceptions**, no one should be able to recognize Ward for being a spirit turned elf, *especially* once they are past their newborn infancy state.
> 
> **Pre-Approved Exceptions**
> - *Exceptions may be made for the following:* 
> 	- Vorgoth
> 	- Spite (*and by extension, potentially Lucanis*)
> 	- Solas
> 	- Felassan
> 	- The Evanuris
> 	- The Forgotten Ones
> 	- Ancient Elves
> 	- particularly powerful spirits & demons
> 	- those who are extremely Fade sensitive
