> [!headcanon]- Varric's Shadow
> With Varric being the only familiar face beyond Solas at first, Ward is quick to be on the dwarf's heels, shadowing him around Haven, and later Skyhold. He becomes their *de facto* guardian when the Inquisition can't simply just send them back to Nevarra on their own, and Vorgoth is cryptic about them being "where they should be".
> 
> Eventually, it may come out that Ward is not unlike Cole, and the fact that *both* spirits attach themselves to Varric is certainly bound to raise some questions as to what it is about the man that attracts such spirits to him.
