# Quotes & Catchphrases
- "I killed them like dogs, Shianni. Not just them. All the humans who hurt you." — *said to her cousin, Shianni, after freeing her and the other women stolen from the Alienage - 9:30 Dragon.*
- "Believe in whatever you like; absent creators or whimsical gods. Follow prophets or ashkaati, or omens in the earth and sky. You will find wisdom only if you seek it." — *quoting Sten's wisdom from their time traveling together during the Fifth Blight.*

# Trivia
- Ashina's first kills were the ones she made freeing herself after being kidnapped, and she killed *each and every guard and human noble* that she came across, leaving a river of blood trailing behind her as she fought to try to reach Shianni in time.
