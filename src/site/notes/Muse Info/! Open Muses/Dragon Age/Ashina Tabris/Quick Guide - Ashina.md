## Things *You* Should Know
> [!attention]+ Ashina Tabris is "dead"
> *Please pay attention to this fact:*
> - Ashina **NEVER** goes by "***Tabris***" with anyone she's met after becoming a Grey Warden and/or an Antivan Crow (*so anyone met after the events of the Origins prologue*). 
> - No one who didn't know her prior to one or both of these events should even know her family name *at all* unless she explicitly tells them or it's revealed to them through the story itself (*example: those present during the Fifth Blight when she returns to the Alienage may learn her true identity as a result of her interacting with her family*).
> 
> **Pre-Approved Exceptions**
> - *Of those who may know without prior plotting include:* 
> 	- Cyrion Tabris
> 	- Shianni
> 	- Soris
> 	- Nelaros
> 	- other Denerim Alienage elves from and/or prior to 9:30 Dragon
> 	- Duncan

> [!spoiler]- Adaia (mother) was an Antivan Crow of House Arainai
> - TBA

> [!stats]- Questions of Paternity
> There were plenty of questions around the Denerim Alienage as to whether Cyrion was truly Ashina's father, given the timing so soon after he and Adaia even meet before she is noticeably pregnant, and with how little Ashina actually favors him, while being *very clearly* Antivan. 
> 
>> [!spoiler]-
>> While still in Antiva, Adaia learned she was pregnant, and in House Arainai, a child born of a Crow *becomes* a Crow, and so Adaia flees to Ferelden in hopes of giving her child a chance and a *choice* of their own future. She was vocally against the Alienage tradition of only being recognized as an adult by marrying, fought to keep the *hahren* from trying to force Ashina to marry until she *wanted to*, and preferably for love.
>>
>> Even though she might not be his by blood, Ashina *is* Cyrion's daughter. She doesn't know who her biological father is, but it is most likely another elven Crow in House Arainai.

## Things Your Muse *Could* Know
> [!hint]- Warden Tathas Arainai is killed by the Crows in 9:33 Dragon
> (*verse/timeline dependent* - **Ashina must be a Grey Warden & the HoF**)
> - TBA

> [!hint]- Warden Tathas Arainai is wanted by Weisshaupt
> (*verse/timeline dependent* - **Ashina must be a Grey Warden & the HoF**)
> 
> The First Warden has ordered that "*Warden Tathas Arainai*", also known as the Hero of Ferelden, the Warden-Commander of Ferelden, and *de facto* Arlessa of Amaranthine, be brought in to Weisshaupt for questioning pertaining to her survival after killing the Archdemon Urthemiel, as well as her encounter with the Architect, among many other things he seeks answer to about her activities during the Fifth Blight itself.
> 
> **Timeline in effect:**
> - *Post-Amaranthine Crisis* — 9:31 Dragon onward
> 
> **Who should know this fact:**
> - *Grey Wardens* — most wardens enlisted at the time in and/or after 9:31 Dragon are under orders by the First Warden to bring "Warden Tathas" in by any means necessary for questioning.
> - *Antivan Crows* — must be influential enough to have been made aware of any details, but rumours are bound to have spread throughout the Houses, even among the fledglings, when they learn of the de Riva fledgling joining the ranks in 9:31 Dragon who is a Grey Warden and the new Warden-Commander of Antiva.

> [!attention]- Searching for a cure for the blight
> (*verse/timeline dependent* - **Ashina must be a Grey Warden**)

## Things Your Muse Should *Not* Know
> [!attention]- Ashina is Warden Tathas Arainai - the Hero of Ferelden
> (*verse/timeline conditional* - **Ashina must be a Grey Warden & the HoF**)
> - When Ashina is conscripted into the Grey Wardens, she *insists* that she not be enlisted under her real name, for her family's protection.
> - The name in the recruit roster lists her as "*Tathas Adaia Arainai*" — named such after the story she tells the kids playing in the alley about the elven hero-thief, and her mother.
> - Once she leaves Denerim, only Duncan knows her true identity, but only refers to her as Tathas, per her request — it is this name that she uses to introduce herself throughout the course of the Fifth Blight, and throughout the Amaranthine Crisis.
> 
> **Pre-Established Exceptions** (*open to plotting*)
> - There are *some* who may know her true identity after 9:33 Dragon, when she joins the Antivan Crows. This includes a few of the Talons, primarily the Fifth Talon (*Viago's predecessor*) and First Talon (*likely Caterina Dellamorte*), as well as a handful of Master Assassins and other influential Crows, such as **Viago de Riva**, **Andarateia Cantori**, and **Lucanis Dellamorte** (*if they do not know the truth sooner, they will likely learn it when they become Talons themselves*).
> 
> **When This Could Be Revealed** (*open to plotting*)
> - **Veilguard (9:50 - 9:54 Dragon)**
> 	- *ROOK:* de Riva or Thorne
> 	- *RECRUITMENT:* Lucanis Dellamorte &/or Davrin
> 	- *ENCOUNTER:* First Warden & Senior Wardens
> 	- *EVENT:* Blighted dragon attack on Treviso
> 	- *EVENT:* Siege at Weisshaupt
> - **Inquisition (9:40 - 9:44 Dragon)**
> 	- *COMPANION:* Varric Tethras &/or Hawke (*if met in Kirkwall*)
> 	- *ENCOUNTER:* Senior Wardens
> 	- *LOCATION:* City of Redcliffe
> 	- *ENCOUNTER:* King &/or Queen of Ferelden
> 	- *ENCOUNTER:* Hawke's Grey Warden Contact
> 	- *EVENT:* Siege at Adamant Fortress
> - **Kirkwall (9:35 - 9:39 Dragon)**
> 	- *COMPANION:* Anders &/or Justice
> 	- *EVENT:* Deep Roads Expedition
> 	- *EVENT:* Qunari Invasion of Kirkwall
> 	- *ENCOUNTER:* Nathanial Howe
> 	- *EVENT:* Fall of the Gallows
