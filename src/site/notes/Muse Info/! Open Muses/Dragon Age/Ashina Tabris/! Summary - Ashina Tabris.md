# Canon Typical

> - *Defaults to Veilguard era timelines. (9:45 - 9:54 Dragon)*
> 
> **Ashina de Riva** is a Master Assassin of House de Riva of the Antivan Crows, likely serving as the Fifth Talon's Second, and is the Warden-Commander of Antiva. She specialises in contacts for entire noble households, methodically wiping out an entire family line and their house in a single evening.
> 
> While it is known among the Crows that she is also a Grey Warden, few outside of a handful of Talons and other high ranking Crows know that she is, in fact, the notorious Hero of Ferelden, widely known as "*Warden Tathas*", who joined the Antivan Crows in 9:33 Dragon to escape from Weisshaupt and the First Warden's orders that she be brought in for questioning regarding her surviving killing an archdemon.

> One thing Ashina can never turn her back on is slavery, especially after the incident in the Denerim Alienage during the Fifth Blight, so there was simply no way she was going to ignore the Antaam slavers, *especially* when she spotted one of her own friends in their cages — not even to report in to her Talon for instruction.
> 
> Her actions disrupt the Talons' plans — plans she hadn't been at all aware of — and as a result, she is sent on an extended contract to hunt the Dread Wolf when Varric Tethras shows up requesting her help in stopping Solas from destroying the world.

> Ashina hadn't wanted anything to do with the Divine's Conclave, nor the Mage-Templar conflict, but she has no choice when the First Talon orders her to go spy on the meetings. When she finds signs of a Grey Warden presence at the Conclave, she knows *something* isn't right, and heads to where she suspects the records might be kept to check the list of expected attendees, only to stumble across the Warden mages in the middle of a blood magic ritual, and the Divine their intended sacrifice.
> 
> When Ashina wakes up in the dungeon under Haven's chantry with now real memory of what happened at the temple, and a magical hole in her hand, she dreads having to send word back to the Talons to provide her report and try to explain how a Master Assassin is being accused of murdering the Divine, and worse still, once the Breach is calmed, is being called the Herald of Andraste.

While she is being hailed as a murderer one minute — "*Assassin*, thank you, — and the Herald of Andraste the next, she must find a way to send report to her Talon and hope things don't somehow get any worse...

Finding that she has had a child since fleeing Antiva, they capture Ashina, taking her back to Antiva and into the House to finish the training Adaia had begun. A child born of a Crow *becomes* a Crow, and Ashina is no exception.

> Trained as a Crow after having been taken by force into the Crows and the House, Ashina is among one of many Crows sent to Ferelden during the Fifth Blight, though her target is Vaughan Kendall, the Arl of Denerim's son, who is known for his particular... *tastes*, and the broken elven bodies that usually are the result.

> Ashina escapes the Arl's Palace with her cousins and the other kidnapped women after she killed the Arl's son, his noble lackies, and all the guards that stood between her and the other elven women who had been taken to Vaughan Kendall's bedroom to be raped and/or killed. The city guard arrive shortly after the elves do, so Ashina claims sole responsibility for the slaughter at the practice and is immediately arrested and thrown into the palace dungeons for the Arl to decide her fate once he returns from Ostagar.
> 
> Ashina has no intention of *staying* in the dungeons, waiting to be executed, so she looks for any way she can to escape her cell. When a Crow appears, she takes the offer for assistance getting out of the palace and Denerim in return for service to the Antivan Crows.

> Despite her decades-long search, Ashina eventually succumbs to the blight in her veins, overcome by the Calling she has tried to avoid for so long. Refusing to keep the Warden tradition of fighting in the Deep Roads until her death — *or worse* — she instead turns to the Crows for a final contract to end her life. 
> 
> But the world isn't finished with her yet, when she finds herself waking in a pile of shattered lyrium, and she's faced with being changed in a new way — no longer blighted, but now she isn't quite sure *what* she is anymore...

# Footnotes
[^1]: Ashina never uses her real name throughout the course of the Fifth Blight, and so the Hero of Ferelden is only known as *Tathas Arainai*, who is said to have been killed by Antivan Crows in 9:33 Dragon.
