# Open Muses Roster
> [!FAQ]- What Are Open Muses?
> **Open Muses** are my *primary muses*, though that does *not* mean that they share the same activity level, as I base that off of *fandom* more than individual muse, as it tends to vary drastically, plus all of my muses have AUs for all of my primary fandoms. So while a muse's fandom might be tertiary in terms of activity, their verses/AUs for the primary fandom would likely have higher activity.
> 
> These are the muses that, unless you tell me you're *not* interested in them by filling out the (Dis)Interest Tracker form, then they are who I am more likely to throw your way at random, from any of their canon-based verses and/or fandom matched AUs.
# Baldur's Gate

> [!muse]- Archfey Warlock of the Prince of Frost
> Tavares is a warlock in service of the Prince of Frost, tasked with bringing misfortune to Faerûn in exchange for being allowed to return to the material plane after "*seven years and a day*" that proved to have lasted *decades* longer than were claimed.

# Dragon Age
## Ashina de Riva née Tabris

> [!muse]- Hero of Ferelden turned Antivan Crow
> Ashina was conscripted against her will into the Grey Wardens at the start of the Fifth Blight in 9:30 Dragon, going by the name of "*Tathas Arainai*". By 9:31 Dragon, she was notoreous among the Wardens by having survived killing the archdemon and ending the Blight, only then to encounter the darkspawn magister known only as the Architect several months later, and then letting it live. The First Warden issued orders for her to be brought in — *alive* — to Weisshaupt for questioning. No warden had survived the attempt until she was said to have been killed by the Antivan Crows in 9:33 Dragon.
