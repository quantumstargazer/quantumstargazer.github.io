# Open Muses Roster
> [!rule]- Interest Assumed Unless Told Otherwise
> Unless you tell me you're *not* interested in them by filling out the **Disinterest Tracker** form, then these are the muses who I am more likely to throw your way at random, from ***any*** of their canon-based verses and/or fandom matched AUs (*ie I will match your muse's fandom with a verse/AU of my own for that muse, regardless of the muse's origin fandom — so if you write Dragon Age, I may send a Baldur's Gate and/or Mass Effect muse your way, but it will be from one of their corresponding Dragon Age verses/AUs, not their respective canon-based verses*).

> [!FAQ]- What Are Open Muses?
> **Open Muses** are my *primary muses*, though that does *not* mean that they share the same activity level, as I base that off of *fandom* more than individual muse, as it tends to vary drastically, plus all of my muses have AUs for all of my primary fandoms. So while a muse's fandom might be tertiary in terms of activity, their verses/AUs for the primary fandom would likely have higher activity.

> *City Elf — ~~Grey Wardens (defected)~~ Antivan Crows — Master Assassin*
> ![Ash001.png|red|100](/img/user/z%20Assets/Attachments/Ash001.png)
> 
> Ashina is conscripted against her will into the Grey Wardens at the start of the Fifth Blight in 9:30 Dragon, going by the name of "**Tathas Arainai**". By 9:31 Dragon, she is notorious among the Wardens for having survived killing the archdemon and ending the Blight, only then to encounter the darkspawn magister known only as the Architect several months later, and letting it live. The First Warden issued orders for her to be brought in — *alive* — to Weisshaupt for questioning. No warden has survived the attempt until she is said to have been killed by the Antivan Crows in 9:33 Dragon.
> 
> In 9:33 Dragon, Ashina enters negotiations with the Fifth Talon of House de Riva, seeking protection from the Grey Wardens in exchange for her service to the House and the Crows. She is now a Master Assassin of House de Riva, and may serve as the Fifth Talon's Second.

> *~~Casteless Royal Bastard~~ Dwarf — Antivan Crows — Assassin Duelist*
> ![Zae001.png|red|100](/img/user/z%20Assets/Attachments/Zae001.png)
> 
> Purchased by a House Arainai from her noble hunter mother in Orzammar mere days after her birth, Zaehire is raised from infancy to be a Crow. She is later freed from House Arainai by the Black Shadow, who aids her in getting as far as Salle, where she is taken in by House de Riva.
> 
> As a fledgling of House de Riva, Zaehire becomes Viago's protégé, as well as an occasional thorn in his side with her impulsiveness. And yet she often manages to turn those impulsive tendencies into boons for House de Riva, such as when she manages to negotiate her way into acting as a liaison between the House and the Carta, securing a steady supply of lyrium for de Riva's mages, and ensuring Carta assassins don't interfere in de Riva contracts.

> 
> Leonardo was the third son of a minor noble family in Salle, Antiva — a noble family that was desperately hiding its destitution from the rest of society. In 9:36, his parents and two older brothers are killed by Antivan Crows, and he is instead taken into House de Riva.
> 
> When he is first brought into the House, he begins training as a rogue, only for his magic to make itself known many weeks later. He doesn't give up on his rogue training, insisting that he can manage both it *and* his magical training, and while many expected him to fail, his sheer determination to prove himself worthy of being a de Riva leads to his eventually studying to be a Spellblade Assassin.

> 
> Ward Ingellvar is a foundling of the Necropolis, discovered deep within the lower levels of the Grand Necropolis as an infant by benevolent undead. As Vorgoth's ward, the elven child is raised within the Necropolis and the Mourn Watch. Their magic is awakened by the instability rippling through the Fade when the Breach opens in the south in 9:41 Dragon.
> 
> Ward is quiet and often reserved, tending to prefer the company of spirits and the benevolent undead. They are largely inexperienced when it comes to interacting with the living, especially anyone outside of the Mourn Watch and the Grand Necropolis, though they are always willing to learn, even if others aren't always as receptive to them in return.

> 
> In 9:45 Dragon, Zevran takes advantage of the chaos among the Houses with half of their Talons dead — including the Eighth Talon of House Arainai — and thus he claims the House and the position for himself, deciding that the only way the House is ever truly going to change is if they are destroyed completely, or he takes control of them himself.

> 
> Born in Arlathan Forest amidst the ancient elvhen ruins, Haleir has long since been fascinated by Fen'Harel, spending her time playing around the wolf statues. When her magic awakens when she is only four years old, she is one mage too many for her clan to handle. With the next Arlathvhen being only two years away, the Keeper decides to start her magical training, but reaches out to the other clans to see who might be in need of a First, and she is traded to Clan Lavellan for that very purpose during the gathering of the clans.
> 
> In 9:41 Dragon, she ends up in the center of the chaos in southern Thedas with the Inquisition, going from being suspected of murder of the Divine to being named the Herald of Andraste in rapid succession. Soon after, she is named the Inquisitor, and leads the Inquisition to victory against Corypheus.
> 
> In 9:44 Dragon, Haleir abandons the Inquisition after learning who Solas *truly* is, instead joining him and his cause, following him through the eluvian.

> 
> Isabela Shepard is an engineer, elite N7 operative, and the first human to be accepted as a Council Spectre. She is a registered biotic, but only possesses limited yet powerful biotic skill in combat.
> 
> She often defies expectations, as she refuses to kowtow to the Alliance's demands of putting humanity's interests first. Once she is given Spectre status, she stops answering to the Alliance Brass, pushing the fact that she now answers to no one but the Council, and refusing to become the Alliance's puppet Spectre.

Nihlus survives the attempt on his life, and joins his own protégé in their hunt to bring Saren to justice for the older Spectre's betrayal of the Council — and to hopefully find answers for himself for why Saren would betray *him*.
