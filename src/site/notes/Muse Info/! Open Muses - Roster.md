# Open Muses Roster
> [!rule]- Interest Assumed Unless Told Otherwise
> Unless you tell me you're *not* interested in them by filling out the **(Dis)Interest Tracker** form, then these are the muses who I am more likely to throw your way at random, from ***any*** of their canon-based verses and/or fandom matched AUs (*ie I will match your muse's fandom with a verse/AU of my own for that muse, regardless of the muse's origin fandom — so if you write Dragon Age, I may send a Baldur's Gate and/or Mass Effect muse your way, but it will be from one of their corresponding Dragon Age verses/AUs, not their canon-based verses*).

> [!FAQ]- What Are Open Muses?
> **Open Muses** are my *primary muses*, though that does *not* mean that they share the same activity level, as I base that off of *fandom* more than individual muse, as it tends to vary drastically, plus all of my muses have AUs for all of my primary fandoms. So while a muse's fandom might be tertiary in terms of activity, their verses/AUs for the primary fandom would likely have higher activity.

By 9:31 Dragon, she was notoreous among the Wardens by having survived killing the archdemon and ending the Blight, only then to encounter the darkspawn magister known only as the Architect several months later, and then letting it live. The First Warden issued orders for her to be brought in — *alive* — to Weisshaupt for questioning. No warden had survived the attempt until she was said to have been killed by the Antivan Crows in 9:33 Dragon.
> 
> In 9:33 Dragon, Ashina enters negotiations with the Fifth Talon of House de Riva, seeking protection from the Grey Wardens in exchange for her service to the House and the Crows.
